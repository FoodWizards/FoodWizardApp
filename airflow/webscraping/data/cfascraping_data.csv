"In this section, we explain what alternative investments are and why assets under management in alternative investments have grown in recent decades. We also explain how alternative investments differ from traditional investments, and we examine their perceived investment merit. We conclude this section with a brief overview of the various categories of alternative investments; these categories will be explored further in later sections. Alternative investments is a label for a disparate group of investments that are distinguished from long-only, publicly traded investments in stocks, bonds, and cash (often referred to as traditional investments). The terms traditional and alternative should not imply that alternatives are necessarily uncommon or that they are relatively recent additions to the investment universe. Alternative investments include such assets as real estate and commodities, which are arguably two of the oldest types of investments. Alternative investments also include non-traditional approaches to investing within special vehicles, such as private equity funds and hedge funds. These funds may give the manager flexibility to use derivatives and leverage, to make investments in illiquid assets, and to take short positions. The assets in which these vehicles invest can include traditional assets (stocks, bonds, and cash) as well as less traditional assets. Management of alternative investments is typically active. Alternative investments often have many of the following characteristics: Narrow specialization of the investment managers Relatively low correlation of returns with those of traditional investments Less regulation and less transparency than traditional investments Limited historical risk and return data Unique legal and tax considerations Higher fees, often including performance or incentive fees Concentrated portfolios Restrictions on redemptions (i.e., lockups and gates)","The member should be able to: describe types and categories of alternative investments; describe characteristics of direct investment, co-investment, and fund investment methods for alternative investments; describe investment and compensation structures commonly used in alternative investments; explain investment characteristics of hedge funds; explain investment characteristics of private capital; explain investment characteristics of natural resources; explain investment characteristics of real estate; explain investment characteristics of infrastructure; describe issues in performance appraisal of alternative investments; calculate and interpret returns of alternative investments on both before-fee and after-fee bases.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2022/pdf/introduction-alternative-investments.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/introduction-alternative-investments,"This reading provides a comprehensive introduction to alternative investments. Some key points of the reading are as follows: Alternative investments are supplemental strategies to traditional long-only positions in stocks, bonds, and cash. Alternative investments include investments in five main categories: hedge funds, private capital, natural resources, real estate, and infrastructure. Alternative investment strategies are typically active, return-seeking strategies that also often have risk characteristics different from those of traditional long-only investments. Characteristics common to many alternative investments, when compared with traditional investments, include the following: lower liquidity, less regulation, lower transparency, higher fees, and limited and potentially problematic historical risk and return data. Alternative investments often have complex legal and tax considerations and may be highly leveraged. Alternative investments are attractive to investors because of the potential for portfolio diversification resulting in a higher risk-adjusted return for the portfolio. Investors can access alternative invests in three ways: Fund investment (such as a in a PE fund) Direct investment into a company or project (such as infrastructure or real estate) Co-investment into a portfolio company of a fund Investors conduct due diligence prior to investing in alternative investments. The due diligence approach depends on the investment method (direct, co-investing, or fund investing). Operational, financial, counterparty, and liquidity risks may be key considerations for those investing in alternative investments. These risks can be analyzed during the due diligence process. It is critical to perform fund due diligence to assess whether (a) the manager can effectively pursue the proposed investment strategy; (b) the appropriate organizational structure and policies for managing investments, operations, risk, and compliance are in place; and (c) the fund terms appear reasonable. Many alternative investments, such as hedge and private equity funds, use a partnership structure with a general partner that manages the business and limited partners (investors) who own fractional interests in the partnership. The general partner typically receives a management fee based on assets under management or committed capital (the former is common to hedge funds, and the latter is common to private equity funds) and an incentive fee based on realized profits. Hurdle rates, high-water marks, lockup and notice periods, and clawback provisions are often specified in the LPA. The fee structure affects the returns to investors (limited partners), with a waterfall representing the distribution method under which allocations are made to LPs and GPs. Waterfalls can be on a whole-of-fund basis (European) or deal-by-deal basis (American). Hedge funds are typically classified by strategy. One such classification includes four broad categories of strategies: equity hedge (e.g., market neutral), event driven (e.g., merger arbitrage), relative value (e.g., convertible bond arbitrage), macro and CTA strategies (e.g., commodity trading advisers). Funds-of-hedge-funds are funds that create a diversified portfolio of hedge funds. These vehicles are attractive to smaller investors that dont have the resources to select individual hedge funds and build a portfolio of them. Private Capital is a broad term for funding provided to companies that is sourced from neither the public equity nor debt markets. Capital that is provided in the form of equity investments is called private equity, whereas capital that is provided as a loan or other form of debt is called private debt. Private equity refers to investment in privately owned companies or in public companies with the intent to take them private. Key private equity investment strategies include leveraged buyouts (e.g., MBOs and MBIs) and venture capital. Primary exit strategies include trade sale, IPO, and recapitalization. Private debt refers to various forms of debt provided by investors to private entities. Key private debt strategies include direct lending, mezzanine debt, and venture debt. Private debt also includes specialized strategies, such as CLOs, unitranche debt, real estate debt, and infrastructure debt. Natural resources include commodities (hard and soft), agricultural land (farmland), and timberland. Commodity investments may involve investing in actual physical commodities or in producers of commodities, but more typically, these investments are made using commodity derivatives (futures or swaps). One can also invest in commodities via a CTA (see hedge funds). Returns to commodity investing are based on changes in price and do not include an income stream, such as dividends, interest, or rent (apart from income earned on the collateral). However, timberland offers an income stream based on the sale of trees, wood, and other products. Timberland can be thought of as both a factory and a warehouse. Plus, timberland is a sustainable investment that mitigates climate-related risks. Farmland, like timberland, has an income component related to harvest quantities and agricultural commodity prices. However, farmland doesnt have the production flexibility of timberland, because farm products must be harvested when ripe. Real estate includes two major sectors: residential and commercial. Residential real estate is the largest sector, making up some 75% of the market globally. Commercial real estate primarily includes office buildings, shopping centers, and warehouses. Real estate property has some unique features compared with other asset classes, including heterogeneity (no two properties are identical) and fixed location. Real estate investments can be direct or indirect, in the public market (e.g., REITs) or private transactions, and in equity or debt. The assets underlying infrastructure investments are real, capital intensive, and long lived. These assets are intended for public use, and they provide essential services. Examples include airports, health care facilities, and power plants. Funding is often done on a public–private partnership basis. Social infrastructure assets are directed toward human activities and include such assets as educational, health care, social housing, and correctional facilities, with the focus on providing, operating, and maintaining the asset infrastructure. Infrastructure investments may also be categorized by the underlying assets stage of development. Investing in infrastructure assets that are to be constructed is generally referred to as greenfield investment. Investing in existing infrastructure assets may be referred to as brownfield investment. Conducting performance appraisal on alternative investments can be challenging because these investments are often characterized by asymmetric risk–return profiles, limited portfolio transparency, illiquidity, product complexity, and complex fee structures. Traditional risk and return measures (such as mean return, standard deviation of returns, and beta) may provide an inadequate picture of alternative investments risk and return characteristics. Moreover, these measures may be unreliable or not representative of specific investments. A variety of ratios can be calculated in order to review the performance of alternative investments, including the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Treynor ratio, Calmar ratio, and MAR ratio. In addition, batting average and slugging percentage can also be used. The IRR calculation is often used to evaluate private equity investments, and the cap rate is often used to evaluate real estate investments. Redemption rules and lockup periods can bring special challenges to performance appraisal of alternative investments. When comparing the performance of alternative investments versus an index, the analyst must be aware that indexes for alternative investments may be subject to a variety of biases, including survivorship and backfill biases. Analysts need to be aware of any custom fee arrangements in place that will affect the calculation of fees and performance. These can include such arrangements as fee discounts based on custom liquidity terms or significant asset size; special share classes, such as founders shares; and a departure from the typical management fee + performance fee structure in favor of either/or fees.",Introduction to Alternative Investments,2023
"Forward commitments include forwards, futures, and swaps. A forward contract is a promise to buy or sell an asset at a future date at a price agreed to at the contracts initiation. The forward contract has a linear payoff function, with both upside and downside risk. A swap is essentially a promise to undertake a transaction at a set price or rate at several dates in the future. The technique we use to price and value swaps is to identify and construct a portfolio with cash flows equivalent to those of the swap. Then, we can use tools, such as the law of one price, to determine swap values from simpler financial instruments, such as a pair of bonds with a cash flow pattern similar to those of our swap. Look out for the big picture: value additivity, arbitrage, and the law of one price are important valuation concepts. Forwards and swaps are widely used in practice to manage a broad range of market risks. As well, more complex derivative instruments can sometimes be understood in terms of their basic building blocks: forwards and option-based components. Here are just some of the many and varied uses for forwards, futures, and swaps that you might encounter in your investment career: Use of equity index futures and swaps by a private wealth manager to hedge equity risk in a low tax basis, concentrated position in his high-net-worth clients portfolio. Use of interest rate swaps by a defined benefits plan manager to hedge interest rate risk and to manage the pension plans duration gap. Use of derivatives (total return swaps, equity futures, bond futures, etc.) overlays by a university endowment for tactical asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing. Use of interest rate swaps by a corporate borrower to synthetically convert floating-rate debt securities to fixed-rate debt securities (or vice versa). Use of VIX futures and inflation swaps by a firms market strategist to infer expectations about market volatility and inflation rates, respectively.","The member should be able to: describe the carry arbitrage model without underlying cashflows and with underlying cashflows; describe how equity forwards and futures are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how interest rate forwards and futures are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how fixed-income forwards and futures are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how interest rate swaps are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how currency swaps are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how equity swaps are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V5R1_pricing_valuation_forward_commitments.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/pricing-and-valuation-of-forward-commitments,"This reading on forward commitment pricing and valuation provides a foundation for understanding how forwards, futures, and swaps are both priced and valued. Key points include the following: The arbitrageur would rather have more money than less and abides by two fundamental rules: Do not use your own money, and do not take any price risk. The no-arbitrage approach is used for the pricing and valuation of forward commitments and is built on the key concept of the law of one price, which states that if two investments have the same future cash flows, regardless of what happens in the future, these two investments should have the same current price. Throughout this reading, the following key assumptions are made: Replicating and offsetting instruments are identifiable and investable. Market frictions are nil. Short selling is allowed with full use of proceeds. Borrowing and lending are available at a known risk-free rate. Carry arbitrage models used for forward commitment pricing and valuation are based on the no-arbitrage approach. With forward commitments, there is a distinct difference between pricing and valuation. Pricing involves the determination of the appropriate fixed price or rate, and valuation involves the determination of the contracts current value expressed in currency units. Forward commitment pricing results in determining a price or rate such that the forward contract value is equal to zero. Using the carry arbitrage model, the forward contract price (F0) is: F0 = FV(S0) = S0(1 + r)T (assuming annual compounding, r) F 0 = FV ( S 0 ) = S 0 exp r c T (assuming continuous compounding, rc ) The key forward commitment pricing equations with carry costs (CC) and carry benefits (CB) are: F0 = FV[S0 + CC0 – CB0] (with discrete compounding) F 0 = S 0 exp ( r c + CC − CB ) T (with continuous compounding) Futures contract pricing in this reading can essentially be treated the same as forward contract pricing. The value of a forward commitment is a function of the price of the underlying instrument, financing costs, and other carry costs and benefits. The key forward commitment valuation equations are: Long Forward: V t = PV [ F t − F 0 ] = [ F t − F 0 ] ( 1 + r ) T − t and Short Forward: − V t = PV [ F 0 − F t ] = [ F 0 − F t ] ( 1 + r ) T − t , With the PV of the difference in forward prices adjusted for carry costs and benefits. Alternatively, Long Forward: V t = S t − P V [ F 0 ] = S t − F 0 ( 1 + r ) T − t and Short Forward: − V t = PV [ F 0 ] − S t = F 0 ( 1 + r ) T − t − S t With equities and fixed-income securities, the forward price is determined such that the initial forward value is zero. A forward rate agreement (FRA) is a forward contract on interest rates. The FRAs fixed interest rate is determined such that the initial value of the FRA is zero. FRA settlements amounts at Time h are: Pay-fixed (Long): NA × {[Lm – FRA0] tm}/[1 + Dmtm] and Receive-fixed (Short): NA × {FRA0 – Lm] tm}/[1 + Dmtm]. The FRAs fixed interest rate (annualized) at contract initiation is: FRA0 = {[1 + LTtT]/[1 + Lhth] – 1}/tm. The Time g value of an FRA initiated at Time 0 is: Long FRA: Vg = NA × {[FRAg – FRA0] tm}/[1+ D(T–g) t(T–g)] and Short FRA: –Vg = NA × {[FRA0 – FRAg] tm}/[1+ D(T–g) t(T–g)]. The fixed-income forward (or futures) price including conversion factor (i.e., adjusted price) is: F0 = Q0 × CF = FV[S0 + CC0 – CB0] = FV[B0 + AI0 – PVCI], and the conversion factor adjusted futures price (i.e., quoted futures price) is: Q0 = [1/CF] {FV [B0 + AI0] – AIT – FVCI}. The general approach to pricing and valuing swaps as covered here is using a replicating portfolio or offsetting portfolio of comparable instruments, typically bonds for interest rate and currency swaps and equities plus bonds for equity swaps. The swap pricing equation, which sets rFIX for the implied fixed bond in an interest rate swap, is: r F I X = 1 − PV n ( 1 ) ∑ i = 1 n PV i ( 1 ) . The value of an interest rate swap at a point in Time t after initiation is the sum of the present values of the difference in fixed swap rates times the stated notional amount, or: V S W A P , t = NA × ( FS 0 − FS t ) × ∑ i = 1 n PV i (Value of receive-fixed swap) and − V S W A P , t = NA × ( FS t − FS 0 ) × ∑ i = 1 n PV i (Value of pay-fixed swap). With a basic understanding of pricing and valuing a simple interest rate swap, it is a straightforward extension to pricing and valuing currency swaps and equity swaps. The solution for each of the three variables, one notional amount (NAa) and two fixed rates (one for each currency, a and b), needed to price a fixed-for-fixed currency swap are : NA a = S 0 × NA b; r a = 1 − PV n , a ( 1 ) ∑ i = 1 n PV i , a ( 1 ) and r b = 1 − PV n , b ( 1 ) ∑ i = 1 n PV i , b ( 1 ) . The currency swap valuation equation, for valuing the swap at time t (after initiation), can be expressed as: V C S = NA a ( r F i x , a ∑ i = 1 n PV i ( 1 ) + PV n ( 1 ) ) − S t NA b ( r F i x , b ∑ i = 1 n PV i ( 1 ) + PV n ( 1 ) ) . For a receive-fixed, pay equity swap, the fixed rate (rFIX) for the implied fixed bond that makes the swaps value (VEQ) equal to 0 at initiation is: r F I X = 1 − P V n ( 1 ) ∑ i = 1 n P V i ( 1 ) . The value of an equity swap at Time t (VEQ,t), after initiation, is: VEQ,t = VFIX(C0) – (St/St–1)NAE – PV(Par – NAE) where VFIX (C0) is the Time t value of a fixed-rate bond initiated with coupon C0 at Time 0, St is the current equity price, St–1 is the equity price at the last reset date, and PV() is the PV function from the swap maturity date to Time t.",Pricing and Valuation of Forward Commitments,2024
"As financial analysts, we often use time-series data to make investment decisions. A time series is a set of observations on a variables outcomes in different time periods: the quarterly sales for a particular company during the past five years, for example, or the daily returns on a traded security. In this reading, we explore the two chief uses of time-series models: to explain the past and to predict the future of a time series. We also discuss how to estimate time-series models, and we examine how a model describing a particular time series can change over time. The following two examples illustrate the kinds of questions we might want to ask about time series. Suppose it is the beginning of 2020 and we are managing a US-based investment portfolio that includes Swiss stocks. Because the value of this portfolio would decrease if the Swiss franc depreciates with respect to the dollar, and vice versa, holding all else constant, we are considering whether to hedge the portfolios exposure to changes in the value of the franc. To help us in making this decision, we decide to model the time series of the franc/dollar exchange rate. Exhibit 1 shows monthly data on the franc/dollar exchange rate. The data are monthly averages of daily exchange rates. Has the exchange rate been more stable since 1987 than it was in previous years? Has the exchange rate shown a long-term trend? How can we best use past exchange rates to predict future exchange rates? As another example, suppose it is the beginning of 2020. We cover retail stores for a sell-side firm and want to predict retail sales for the coming year. Exhibit 2 shows monthly data on US retail sales. The data are not seasonally adjusted, hence the spikes around the holiday season at the turn of each year. Because the reported sales in the stores financial statements are not seasonally adjusted, we model seasonally unadjusted retail sales. How can we model the trend in retail sales? How can we adjust for the extreme seasonality reflected in the peaks and troughs occurring at regular intervals? How can we best use past retail sales to predict future retail sales? Some fundamental questions arise in time-series analysis: How do we model trends? How do we predict the future value of a time series based on its past values? How do we model seasonality? How do we choose among time-series models? And how do we model changes in the variance of time series over time? We address each of these issues in this reading. We first describe typical challenges in applying the linear regression model to time-series data. We present linear and log-linear trend models, which describe, respectively, the value and the natural log of the value of a time series as a linear function of time. We then present autoregressive time-series models—which explain the current value of a time series in terms of one or more lagged values of the series. Such models are among the most commonly used in investments, and the section addresses many related concepts and issues. We then turn our attention to random walks. Because such time series are not covariance stationary, they cannot be modeled using autoregressive models unless they can be transformed into stationary series. We therefore explore appropriate transformations and tests of stationarity. The subsequent sections address moving-average time-series models and discuss the problem of seasonality in time series and how to address it. We also cover autoregressive moving-average models, a more complex alternative to autoregressive models. The last two topics are modeling changing variance of the error term in a time series and the consequences of regression of one time series on another when one or both time series may not be covariance stationary.","The member should be able to: calculate and evaluate the predicted trend value for a time series, modeled as either a linear trend or a log-linear trend, given the estimated trend coefficients; describe factors that determine whether a linear or a log-linear trend should be used with a particular time series and evaluate limitations of trend models; explain the requirement for a time series to be covariance stationary and describe the significance of a series that is not stationary; describe the structure of an autoregressive (AR) model of order p and calculate one- and two-period-ahead forecasts given the estimated coefficients; explain how autocorrelations of the residuals can be used to test whether the autoregressive model fits the time series; explain mean reversion and calculate a mean-reverting level; contrast in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts and compare the forecasting accuracy of different time-series models based on the root mean squared error criterion; explain the instability of coefficients of time-series models; describe characteristics of random walk processes and contrast them to covariance stationary processes; describe implications of unit roots for time-series analysis, explain when unit roots are likely to occur and how to test for them, and demonstrate how a time series with a unit root can be transformed so it can be analyzed with an AR model; describe the steps of the unit root test for nonstationarity and explain the relation of the test to autoregressive time-series models; explain how to test and correct for seasonality in a time-series model and calculate and interpret a forecasted value using an AR model with a seasonal lag; explain autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and describe how ARCH models can be applied to predict the variance of a time series; explain how time-series variables should be analyzed for nonstationarity and/or cointegration before use in a linear regression; and determine an appropriate time-series model to analyze a given investment problem and justify that choice.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R5_time_series_analysis.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/time-series-analysis,"The predicted trend value of a time series in period t is b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 t in a linear trend model; the predicted trend value of a time series in a log-linear trend model is e b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 t . Time series that tend to grow by a constant amount from period to period should be modeled by linear trend models, whereas time series that tend to grow at a constant rate should be modeled by log-linear trend models. Trend models often do not completely capture the behavior of a time series, as indicated by serial correlation of the error term. If the Durbin–Watson statistic from a trend model differs significantly from 2, indicating serial correlation, we need to build a different kind of model. An autoregressive model of order p, denoted AR(p), uses p lags of a time series to predict its current value: xt = b 0 + b 1 xt −1 + b 2 xt −2 + . . . + bpxt – p + ε t . A time series is covariance stationary if the following three conditions are satisfied: First, the expected value of the time series must be constant and finite in all periods. Second, the variance of the time series must be constant and finite in all periods. Third, the covariance of the time series with itself for a fixed number of periods in the past or future must be constant and finite in all periods. Inspection of a nonstationary time-series plot may reveal an upward or downward trend (nonconstant mean) and/or nonconstant variance. The use of linear regression to estimate an autoregressive time-series model is not valid unless the time series is covariance stationary. For a specific autoregressive model to be a good fit to the data, the autocorrelations of the error term should be 0 at all lags. A time series is mean reverting if it tends to fall when its level is above its long-run mean and rise when its level is below its long-run mean. If a time series is covariance stationary, then it will be mean reverting. The one-period-ahead forecast of a variable xt from an AR(1) model made in period t for period t + 1 is x ‸ t + 1 = b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 x t . This forecast can be used to create the two-period-ahead forecast from the model made in period t, x ‸ t + 2 = b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 x t + 1 . Similar results hold for AR(p) models. In-sample forecasts are the in-sample predicted values from the estimated time-series model. Out-of-sample forecasts are the forecasts made from the estimated time-series model for a time period different from the one for which the model was estimated. Out-of-sample forecasts are usually more valuable in evaluating the forecasting performance of a time-series model than are in-sample forecasts. The root mean squared error (RMSE), defined as the square root of the average squared forecast error, is a criterion for comparing the forecast accuracy of different time-series models; a smaller RMSE implies greater forecast accuracy. Just as in regression models, the coefficients in time-series models are often unstable across different sample periods. In selecting a sample period for estimating a time-series model, we should seek to assure ourselves that the time series was stationary in the sample period. A random walk is a time series in which the value of the series in one period is the value of the series in the previous period plus an unpredictable random error. If the time series is a random walk, it is not covariance stationary. A random walk with drift is a random walk with a nonzero intercept term. All random walks have unit roots. If a time series has a unit root, then it will not be covariance stationary. If a time series has a unit root, we can sometimes transform the time series into one that is covariance stationary by first-differencing the time series; we may then be able to estimate an autoregressive model for the first-differenced series. An n-period moving average of the current and past (n − 1) values of a time series, xt , is calculated as [xt + xt −1 + . . . + xt −( n −1)]/n. A moving-average model of order q, denoted MA(q), uses q lags of a random error term to predict its current value. The order q of a moving-average model can be determined using the fact that if a time series is a moving-average time series of order q, its first q autocorrelations are nonzero while autocorrelations beyond the first q are zero. The autocorrelations of most autoregressive time series start large and decline gradually, whereas the autocorrelations of an MA(q) time series suddenly drop to 0 after the first q autocorrelations. This helps in distinguishing between autoregressive and moving-average time series. If the error term of a time-series model shows significant serial correlation at seasonal lags, the time series has significant seasonality. This seasonality can often be modeled by including a seasonal lag in the model, such as adding a term lagged four quarters to an AR(1) model on quarterly observations. The forecast made in time t for time t + 1 using a quarterly AR(1) model with a seasonal lag would be x t + 1 = b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 x t + b ‸ 2 x t − 3 . ARMA models have several limitations: The parameters in ARMA models can be very unstable; determining the AR and MA order of the model can be difficult; and even with their additional complexity, ARMA models may not forecast well. The variance of the error in a time-series model sometimes depends on the variance of previous errors, representing autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH). Analysts can test for first-order ARCH in a time-series model by regressing the squared residual on the squared residual from the previous period. If the coefficient on the squared residual is statistically significant, the time-series model has ARCH(1) errors. If a time-series model has ARCH(1) errors, then the variance of the errors in period t + 1 can be predicted in period t using the formula σ ‸ t + 1 2 = a ‸ 0 + a ‸ 1 ε ‸ t 2 . If linear regression is used to model the relationship between two time series, a test should be performed to determine whether either time series has a unit root: If neither of the time series has a unit root, then we can safely use linear regression. If one of the two time series has a unit root, then we should not use linear regression. If both time series have a unit root and the time series are cointegrated, we may safely use linear regression; however, if they are not cointegrated, we should not use linear regression. The (Engle–Granger) Dickey–Fuller test can be used to determine whether time series are cointegrated.",Time-Series Analysis,2024
"Credit analysis plays an important role in the broader fixed-income space. Our coverage will go over important concepts, tools, and applications of credit analysis. We first look at modeling credit risk. The inputs to credit risk modeling are the expected exposure to default loss, the loss given default, and the probability of default. We explain these terms and use a numerical example to illustrate the calculation of the credit valuation adjustment for a corporate bond and its credit spread over a government bond yield taken as a proxy for a default-risk-free rate (or default-free rate). We then discuss credit scoring and credit ratings. Credit scoring is a measure of credit risk used in retail loan markets, and ratings are used in the wholesale bond market. We explain two types of credit analysis models used in practice—structural models and reduced-form models. Both models are highly mathematical and beyond the scope of our coverage. Therefore, we provide only an overview to highlight the key ideas and the similarities and differences between them. We then use the arbitrage-free framework and a binomial interest rate tree to value risky fixed-rate and floating-rate bonds for different assumptions about interest rate volatility. We also build on the credit risk model to interpret changes in credit spreads that arise from changes in the assumed probability of default, the recovery rate, or the exposure to default loss. We also explain the term structure of credit spreads and finally compare the credit analysis required for securitized debt with the credit analysis of corporate bonds.","The member should be able to: explain expected exposure, the loss given default, the probability of default, and the credit valuation adjustment; explain credit scores and credit ratings; calculate the expected return on a bond given transition in its credit rating; explain structural and reduced-form models of corporate credit risk, including assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses; calculate the value of a bond and its credit spread, given assumptions about the credit risk parameters; interpret changes in a credit spread; explain the determinants of the term structure of credit spreads and interpret a term structure of credit spreads; compare the credit analysis required for securitized debt to the credit analysis of corporate debt.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R8_credit_analysis_models.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/credit-analysis-models,"This reading has covered several important topics in credit analysis. Among the points made are the following: Three factors important to modeling credit risk are the expected exposure to default, the recovery rate, and the loss given default. These factors permit the calculation of a credit valuation adjustment that is subtracted from the (hypothetical) value of the bond, if it were default risk free, to get the bonds fair value given its credit risk. The credit valuation adjustment is calculated as the sum of the present values of the expected loss for each period in the remaining life of the bond. Expected values are computed using risk-neutral probabilities, and discounting is done at the risk-free rates for the relevant maturities. The CVA captures investors compensation for bearing default risk. The compensation can also be expressed in terms of a credit spread. Credit scores and credit ratings are third-party evaluations of creditworthiness used in distinct markets. Analysts may use credit ratings and a transition matrix of probabilities to adjust a bonds yield-to-maturity to reflect the probabilities of credit migration. Credit spread migration typically reduces expected return. Credit analysis models fall into two broad categories: structural models and reduced-form models. Structural models are based on an option perspective of the positions of the stakeholders of the company. Bondholders are viewed as owning the assets of the company; shareholders have call options on those assets. Reduced-form models seek to predict when a default may occur, but they do not explain the why as do structural models. Reduced-form models, unlike structural models, are based only on observable variables. When interest rates are assumed to be volatile, the credit risk of a bond can be estimated in an arbitrage-free valuation framework. The discount margin for floating-rate notes is similar to the credit spread for fixed-coupon bonds. The discount margin can also be calculated using an arbitrage-free valuation framework. Arbitrage-free valuation can be applied to judge the sensitivity of the credit spread to changes in credit risk parameters. The term structure of credit spreads depends on macro and micro factors. As it concerns macro factors, the credit spread curve tends to become steeper and widen in conditions of weak economic activity. Market supply and demand dynamics are important. The most frequently traded securities tend to determine the shape of this curve. Issuer- or industry-specific factors, such as the chance of a future leverage-decreasing event, can cause the credit spread curve to flatten or invert. When a bond is very likely to default, it often trades close to its recovery value at various maturities; moreover, the credit spread curve is less informative about the relationship between credit risk and maturity. For securitized debt, the characteristics of the asset portfolio themselves suggest the best approach for a credit analyst to take when deciding among investments. Important considerations include the relative concentration of assets and their similarity or heterogeneity as it concerns credit risk.",Credit Analysis Models,2024

A CDS is written on the debt of a third party, called the reference entity, whose relevant debt is called the reference obligation, typically a senior unsecured bond. A CDS written on a particular reference obligation normally provides coverage for all obligations of the reference entity that have equal or higher seniority. The two parties to the CDS are the credit protection buyer, who is said to be short the reference entitys credit, and the credit protection seller, who is said to be long the reference entitys credit. The CDS pays off upon occurrence of a credit event, which includes bankruptcy, failure to pay, and, in some countries, involuntary restructuring. Settlement of a CDS can occur through a cash payment from the credit protection seller to the credit protection buyer as determined by the cheapest-to-deliver obligation of the reference entity or by physical delivery of the reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller in exchange for the CDS notional. A cash settlement payoff is determined by an auction of the reference entitys debt, which gives the markets assessment of the likely recovery rate. The credit protection buyer must accept the outcome of the auction even though the ultimate recovery rate could differ. CDS can be constructed on a single entity or as indexes containing multiple entities. Bespoke CDS or baskets of CDS are also common. The fixed payments made from CDS buyer to CDS seller are customarily set at a fixed annual rate of 1% for investment-grade debt or 5% for high-yield debt. Valuation of a CDS is determined by estimating the present value of the payment leg, which is the series of payments made from the protection buyer to the protection seller, and the present value of the protection leg, which is the payment from the protection seller to the protection buyer in event of default. If the present value of the payment leg is greater than the present value of the protection leg, the protection buyer pays an upfront premium to the seller. If the present value of the protection leg is greater than the present value of the payment leg, the seller pays an upfront premium to the buyer. An important determinant of the value of the expected payments is the hazard rate, the probability of default given that default has not already occurred. CDS prices are often quoted in terms of credit spreads, the implied number of basis points that the credit protection seller receives from the credit protection buyer to justify providing the protection. Credit spreads are often expressed in terms of a credit curve, which expresses the relationship between the credit spreads on bonds of different maturities for the same borrower. CDS change in value over their lives as the credit quality of the reference entity changes, which leads to gains and losses for the counterparties, even though default may not have occurred or may never occur. CDS spreads approach zero as the CDS approaches maturity. Either party can monetize an accumulated gain or loss by entering into an offsetting position that matches the terms of the original CDS. CDS are used to increase or decrease credit exposures or to capitalize on different assessments of the cost of credit among different instruments tied to the reference entity, such as debt, equity, and derivatives of debt and equity.

"The income statement presents information on the financial results of a companys business activities over a period of time. The income statement communicates how much revenue the company generated during a period and what costs it incurred in connection with generating that revenue. The basic equation underlying the income statement, ignoring gains and losses, is Revenue minus Expenses equals Net income. The income statement is also sometimes referred to as the statement of operations, statement of earnings, or profit and loss (P&amp;L) statement. Under both International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), the income statement may be presented as a separate statement followed by a statement of comprehensive income that begins with the profit or loss from the income statement or as a section of a single statement of comprehensive income. This reading focuses on the income statement, and the term income statement will be used to describe either the separate statement that reports profit or loss used for earnings per share calculations or that section of a statement of comprehensive income that reports the same profit or loss. The reading also includes a discussion of comprehensive income (profit or loss from the income statement plus other comprehensive income). Investment analysts intensely scrutinize companies income statements. Equity analysts are interested in them because equity markets often reward relatively high- or low-earnings growth companies with above-average or below-average valuations, respectively, and because inputs into valuation models often include estimates of earnings. Fixed-income analysts examine the components of income statements, past and projected, for information on companies abilities to make promised payments on their debt over the course of the business cycle. Corporate financial announcements frequently emphasize information reported in income statements, particularly earnings, more than information reported in the other financial statements. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the components of the income statement and its format. Section 3 describes basic principles and selected applications related to the recognition of revenue, and Section 4 describes basic principles and selected applications related to the recognition of expenses. Section 5 covers non-recurring items and non-operating items. Section 6 explains the calculation of earnings per share. Section 7 introduces income statement analysis, and Section 8 explains comprehensive income and its reporting.

The income statement presents information on the financial results of a companys business activities over a period of time; it communicates how much revenue the company generated during a period and what costs it incurred in connection with generating that revenue. A companys net income and its components (e.g., gross margin, operating earnings, and pretax earnings) are critical inputs into both the equity and credit analysis processes. Equity analysts are interested in earnings because equity markets often reward relatively high- or low-earnings growth companies with above-average or below-average valuations, respectively. Fixed-income analysts examine the components of income statements, past and projected, for information on companies abilities to make promised payments on their debt over the course of the business cycle. Corporate financial announcements frequently emphasize income statements more than the other financial statements. Key points to this reading include the following: The income statement presents revenue, expenses, and net income. The components of the income statement include: revenue; cost of sales; sales, general, and administrative expenses; other operating expenses; non-operating income and expenses; gains and losses; non-recurring items; net income; and EPS. An income statement that presents a subtotal for gross profit (revenue minus cost of goods sold) is said to be presented in a multi-step format. One that does not present this subtotal is said to be presented in a single-step format. Revenue is recognized in the period it is earned, which may or may not be in the same period as the related cash collection. Recognition of revenue when earned is a fundamental principal of accrual accounting. An analyst should identify differences in companies revenue recognition methods and adjust reported revenue where possible to facilitate comparability. Where the available information does not permit adjustment, an analyst can characterize the revenue recognition as more or less conservative and thus qualitatively assess how differences in policies might affect financial ratios and judgments about profitability. As of the beginning of 2018, revenue recognition standards have converged. The core principle of the converged standards is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in an exchange for those goods or services. To achieve the core principle, the standard describes the application of five steps in recognizing revenue. The standard also specifies the treatment of some related contract costs and disclosure requirements. The general principles of expense recognition include a process to match expenses either to revenue (such as, cost of goods sold) or to the time period in which the expenditure occurs (period costs such as, administrative salaries) or to the time period of expected benefits of the expenditures (such as, depreciation). In expense recognition, choice of method (i.e., depreciation method and inventory cost method), as well as estimates (i.e., uncollectible accounts, warranty expenses, assets useful life, and salvage value) affect a companys reported income. An analyst should identify differences in companies expense recognition methods and adjust reported financial statements where possible to facilitate comparability. Where the available information does not permit adjustment, an analyst can characterize the policies and estimates as more or less conservative and thus qualitatively assess how differences in policies might affect financial ratios and judgments about companies performance. To assess a companys future earnings, it is helpful to separate those prior years items of income and expense that are likely to continue in the future from those items that are less likely to continue. Under IFRS, a company should present additional line items, headings, and subtotals beyond those specified when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entitys financial performance. Some items from prior years clearly are not expected to continue in future periods and are separately disclosed on a companys income statement. Under US GAAP, unusual and/or infrequently occurring items, which are material, are presented separately within income from continuing operations. Non-operating items are reported separately from operating items on the income statement. Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the income statement reports separately the effect of the disposal of a component operation as a discontinued operation. Basic EPS is the amount of income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding over a period. The amount of income available to common shareholders is the amount of net income remaining after preferred dividends (if any) have been paid. If a company has a simple capital structure (i.e., one with no potentially dilutive securities), then its basic EPS is equal to its diluted EPS. If, however, a company has dilutive securities, its diluted EPS is lower than its basic EPS. Diluted EPS is calculated using the if-converted method for convertible securities and the treasury stock method for options. Common-size analysis of the income statement involves stating each line item on the income statement as a percentage of sales. Common-size statements facilitate comparison across time periods and across companies of different sizes. Two income-statement-based indicators of profitability are net profit margin and gross profit margin. Comprehensive income includes both net income and other revenue and expense items that are excluded from the net income calculation.",Understanding Income Statements,2023
"Private equitys shift from a niche activity to a critical component of the financial system is evident from investors financial commitment: around $2.8 trillion globally as of mid-2018. And thats just the equity portion. The use of debt means transaction value is often two or three times the actual equity raised. Blackstone, Carlyle, and KKR are household names and publicly traded companies of significant size. Private equity funds may account for 15%–18% of the value of all mergers and acquisitions, and the market capitalization of Alibaba, Amazon, Facebook, and Google has raised the profile of venture capital investing. We take two approaches to illuminate our subject: In Section 2 the perspective is primarily that of the private equity firm evaluating potential investments. Valuing acquisitions is particularly complex; except for public-to-private transactions, there will be no market prices to refer to, and the challenges are considerable. In Section 3 we take the perspective of an outside investor investing in a fund sponsored by the private equity firm. Definitions of private equity differ, but here we include the entire asset class of equity investments that are not quoted on stock markets. Private equity stretches from venture capital (VC)—working with early-stage companies that may be without revenues but that possess good ideas or technology—to growth equity, providing capital to expand established private businesses often by taking a minority interest, all the way to large buyouts (leveraged buyouts, or LBOs), in which the private equity firm buys the entire company. When the target is publicly traded, the private equity fund performs a public-to-private transaction, removing the target from the stock market. But buyout transactions usually involve private companies and very often a particular division of an existing company. Some exclude venture capital from the private equity universe because of the higher risk profile of backing new companies as opposed to mature ones. For this reading, we refer simply to venture capital and buyouts as the two main forms of private equity. Many classifications of private equity are available. Classifications proposed by the European and Private Equity Venture Capital Association (EVCA) are displayed in Exhibit 1. Exhibit 1. Classification of Private Equity in Terms of Stage and Type of Financing of Portfolio Companies Broad Category Subcategory Brief Description Venture capital Seed stage Financing provided to research business ideas, develop prototype products, or conduct market research Start-up stage Financing to recently created companies with well-articulated business and marketing plans Later (expansion) stage Financing to companies that have started their selling effort and may already be covering costs: Financing may serve to expand production capacity, product development, or provide working capital. Replacement capital Financing provided to purchase shares from other existing venture capital investors or to reduce financial leverage. Growth Expansion capital Financing to established and mature companies in exchange for equity, often a minority stake, to expand into new markets and/or improve operations Buyout Acquisition capital Financing in the form of debt, equity, or quasi-equity provided to a company to acquire another company Leveraged buyout Financing provided by an LBO firm to acquire a company Management buyout Financing provided to the management to acquire a company, specific product line, or division (carve-out) Special situations Mezzanine finance Financing generally provided in the form of subordinated debt and an equity kicker (warrants, equity, etc.) frequently in the context of LBO transactions Distressed/turnaround Financing of companies in need of restructuring or facing financial distress One-time opportunities Financing in relation to changing industry trends and new government regulations Other Other forms of private equity financing are also possible—for example, activist investing, funds of funds, and secondaries. Private equity funds may also be classified geographically, by sector, or both. Certain specialists target real asset classes, such as real estate, infrastructure, energy, and timber, or they seek out emerging or niche sectors, such as agribusiness or royalties in pharmaceuticals, music, film, or TV. US private equity enjoyed a far larger market size historically than private equity in other regions, with few restrictions on hostile takeovers. Buyouts subsequently expanded to Europe and then Asia as friendly deals became commonplace. In broad terms, around four-fifths of the money has been flowing into buyout, growth, and other types of private equity in both the United States and Europe, with buyout amounts far exceeding other types. The sheer scale of buyouts means that an individual deal can absorb billions of dollars in capital. Buyout funds have benefited from increased allocations given their ability to absorb far higher capital amounts and to deliver historically higher-than-average returns. Venture capital deals, in contrast, tend to drip, providing small amounts of feed money. Still, advances in technology and communications are causing the number of venture capital funds and the availability of start-up capital to grow. Investor attention started to shift to China in 2015, an especially active year for raising capital. VC funds targeting Asia had more than US$200 billion in 2017, up from US$50 billion in 2010. Most private equity money comes from institutional investors, such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and insurance companies, although many family offices and high-net-worth individuals also invest directly or through fund-of-funds intermediaries. Venture capital investors include government agencies and corporations seeking to promote regional investment or gain insight into, and possibly control of, emerging businesses and technologies. Private equity investment is characterized by a buy-to-sell orientation: Investors typically expect their money to be returned, with a handsome profit, within 10 years of committing their funds. The economic incentives of the funds are aligned with this goal.","The member should be able to: explain sources of value creation in private equity; explain how private equity firms align their interests with those of the managers of portfolio companies; distinguish between the characteristics of buyout and venture capital investments; interpret LBO model and VC method output; explain alternative exit routes in private equity and their impact on value; explain risks and costs of investing in private equity; explain private equity fund structures, terms, due diligence, and valuation in the context of an analysis of private equity fund returns; interpret and compare financial performance of private equity funds from the perspective of an investor; calculate management fees, carried interest, net asset value, distributed to paid in (DPI), residual value to paid in (RVPI), and total value to paid in (TVPI) of a private equity fund.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L2V5R6-private-equity-investments.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/private-equity-investments,"Private equity funds seek to add value by various means, including optimizing financial structures, incentivizing management, and creating operational improvements. Private equity can be thought of as an alternative system of governance for corporations: Rather than ownership and control being separated as in most publicly quoted companies, private equity concentrates ownership and control. Many view the combination of ownership and control as a fundamental source of the returns earned by the best private equity funds. A critical role for the GP is valuation of potential investments. But because these investments are usually privately owned, valuation encounters many challenges. Valuation techniques differ according to the nature of the investment. Early-stage ventures require very different techniques than leveraged buyouts. Private equity professionals tend to use multiple techniques when performing a valuation, and they explore many different scenarios for the future development of the business. In buyouts, the availability of debt financing can have a big impact on the scale of private equity activity, and it seems to impact valuations observed in the market. Because private equity funds are incentivized to acquire, add value, and then exit within the lifetime of the fund, they are considered buy-to-sell investors. Planning the exit route for the investment is a critical role for the GP, and a well-timed and well-executed investment can be a significant source of realized value. In addition to the problems encountered by the private equity funds in valuing potential portfolio investments, challenges exist in valuing the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis. This is because the investments have no easily observed market value and there is a large element of judgment involved in valuing each of the portfolio companies prior to their sale by the fund. The two main metrics for measuring the ongoing and ultimate performance of private equity funds are IRR and multiples. Comparisons of PE returns across funds and with other assets are demanding because it is important to control for the timing of cash flows, differences in risk and portfolio composition, and vintage-year effects.",Private Equity Investments,2023
"The valuation of a fixed-rate, option-free bond generally requires determining its future cash flows and discounting them at the appropriate rates. Valuation becomes more complicated when a bond has one or more embedded options because the values of embedded options are typically contingent on interest rates. Understanding how to value and analyze bonds with embedded options is important for practitioners. Issuers of bonds often manage interest rate exposure with embedded options, such as call provisions. Investors in callable bonds must appreciate the risk of being called. The perception of this risk is collectively represented by the premium, in terms of increased coupon or yield, that the market demands for callable bonds relative to otherwise identical option-free bonds. Issuers and investors must also understand how other types of embedded options—such as put provisions, conversion options, caps, and floors—affect bond values and the sensitivity of these bonds to interest rate movements. We first provide a brief overview of various types of embedded options. We then discuss bonds that include a call or put provision. Taking a building-block approach, we show how the arbitrage-free valuation framework discussed earlier can be applied to the valuation of callable and putable bonds—first in the absence of interest rate volatility, and then when interest rates fluctuate. We also discuss how option-adjusted spreads are used to value risky callable and putable bonds. We then turn to interest rate sensitivity. It highlights the need to use effective duration, including one-sided durations and key rate durations, as well as effective convexity to assess the effect of interest rate movements on the value of callable and putable bonds. We also explain the valuation of capped and floored floating-rate bonds (floaters) and convertible bonds.","The member should be able to: describe fixed-income securities with embedded options; explain the relationships between the values of a callable or putable bond, the underlying option-free (straight) bond, and the embedded option; describe how the arbitrage-free framework can be used to value a bond with embedded options; explain how interest rate volatility affects the value of a callable or putable bond; explain how changes in the level and shape of the yield curve affect the value of a callable or putable bond; calculate the value of a callable or putable bond from an interest rate tree; explain the calculation and use of option-adjusted spreads; explain how interest rate volatility affects option-adjusted spreads; calculate and interpret effective duration of a callable or putable bond; compare effective durations of callable, putable, and straight bonds; describe the use of one-sided durations and key rate durations to evaluate the interest rate sensitivity of bonds with embedded options; compare effective convexities of callable, putable, and straight bonds; calculate the value of a capped or floored floating-rate bond; describe defining features of a convertible bond; calculate and interpret the components of a convertible bonds value; describe how a convertible bond is valued in an arbitrage-free framework; compare the risk–return characteristics of a convertible bond with the risk–return characteristics of a straight bond and of the underlying common stock.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R7_valuation_analysis_bonds_embedded_options.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/valuation-analysis-bonds-embedded-options,"An embedded option represents a right that can be exercised by the issuer, by the bondholder, or automatically depending on the course of interest rates. It is attached to, or embedded in, an underlying option-free bond called a straight bond. Simple embedded option structures include call options, put options, and extension options. Callable and putable bonds can be redeemed prior to maturity, at the discretion of the issuer in the former case and of the bondholder in the latter case. An extendible bond gives the bondholder the right to keep the bond for a number of years after maturity. Putable and extendible bonds are equivalent, except that their underlying option-free bonds are different. Complex embedded option structures include bonds with other types of options or combinations of options. For example, a convertible bond includes a conversion option that allows the bondholders to convert their bonds into the issuers common stock. A bond with an estate put can be put by the heirs of a deceased bondholder. Sinking fund bonds make the issuer set aside funds over time to retire the bond issue and are often callable, may have an acceleration provision, and may also contain a delivery option. Valuing and analyzing bonds with complex embedded option structures is challenging. According to the arbitrage-free framework, the value of a bond with an embedded option is equal to the arbitrage-free values of its parts—that is, the arbitrage-free value of the straight bond and the arbitrage-free values of each of the embedded options. Because the call option is an issuer option, the value of the call option decreases the value of the callable bond relative to an otherwise identical but non-callable bond. In contrast, because the put option is an investor option, the value of the put option increases the value of the putable bond relative to an otherwise identical but non-putable bond. In the absence of default and interest rate volatility, the bonds future cash flows are certain. Thus, the value of a callable or putable bond can be calculated by discounting the bonds future cash flows at the appropriate one-period forward rates, taking into consideration the decision to exercise the option. If a bond is callable, the decision to exercise the option is made by the issuer, which will exercise the call option when the value of the bonds future cash flows is higher than the call price. In contrast, if the bond is putable, the decision to exercise the option is made by the bondholder, who will exercise the put option when the value of the bonds future cash flows is lower than the put price. In practice, interest rates fluctuate and interest rate volatility affects the value of embedded options. Thus, when valuing bonds with embedded options, it is important to consider the possible evolution of the yield curve over time. Interest rate volatility is modeled using a binomial interest rate tree. The higher the volatility, the lower the value of the callable bond and the higher the value of the putable bond. Valuing a bond with embedded options assuming an interest rate volatility requires three steps: (1) Generate a tree of interest rates based on the given yield curve and volatility assumptions; (2) at each node of the tree, determine whether the embedded options will be exercised; and (3) apply the backward induction valuation methodology to calculate the present value of the bond. The option-adjusted spread is the single spread added uniformly to the one-period forward rates on the tree to produce a value or price for a bond. OAS is sensitive to interest rate volatility: The higher the volatility, the lower the OAS for a callable bond. For bonds with embedded options, the best measure to assess the sensitivity of the bonds price to a parallel shift of the benchmark yield curve is effective duration. The effective duration of a callable or putable bond cannot exceed that of the straight bond. When the option is near the money, the convexity of a callable bond is negative, indicating that the upside for a callable bond is much smaller than the downside, whereas the convexity of a putable bond is positive, indicating that the upside for a putable bond is much larger than the downside. Because the prices of callable and putable bonds respond asymmetrically to upward and downward interest rate changes of the same magnitude, one-sided durations provide a better indication regarding the interest rate sensitivity of bonds with embedded options than (two-sided) effective duration. Key rate durations show the effect of shifting only key points, one at a time, rather than the entire yield curve. The arbitrage-free framework can be used to value capped and floored floaters. The cap provision in a floater is an issuer option that prevents the coupon rate from increasing above a specified maximum rate. Thus, the value of a capped floater is equal to or less than the value of the straight bond. In contrast, the floor provision in a floater is an investor option that prevents the coupon from decreasing below a specified minimum rate. Thus, the value of a floored floater is equal to or higher than the value of the straight bond. The characteristics of a convertible bond include the conversion price, which is the applicable share price at which the bondholders can convert their bonds into common shares, and the conversion ratio, which reflects the number of shares of common stock that the bondholders receive from converting their bonds into shares. The conversion price is adjusted in case of corporate actions, such as stock splits, bonus share issuances, and rights and warrants issuances. Convertible bondholders may receive compensation when the issuer pays dividends to its common shareholders, and they may be given the opportunity to either put their bonds or convert their bonds into shares earlier and at more advantageous terms in the case of a change of control. A number of investment metrics and ratios help analyze and value convertible bonds. The conversion value indicates the value of the bond if it is converted at the market price of the shares. The minimum value of a convertible bond sets a floor value for the convertible bond at the greater of the conversion value or the straight value. This floor is moving, however, because the straight value is not fixed. The market conversion premium represents the price investors effectively pay for the underlying shares if they buy the convertible bond and then convert it into shares. Scaled by the market price of the shares, it represents the premium payable when buying the convertible bond rather than the underlying common stock. Because convertible bonds combine characteristics of bonds, stocks, and options, as well as potentially other features, their valuation and analysis are challenging. Convertible bond investors should consider the factors that affect not only bond prices but also the underlying share price. The arbitrage-free framework can be used to value convertible bonds, including callable and putable ones. Each component (straight bond, call option of the stock, and call and/or put option on the bond) can be valued separately. The risk–return characteristics of a convertible bond depend on the underlying share price relative to the conversion price. When the underlying share price is well below the conversion price, the convertible bond is busted and exhibits mostly bond risk–return characteristics. Thus, it is mainly sensitive to interest rate movements. In contrast, when the underlying share price is well above the conversion price, the convertible bond exhibits mostly stock risk–return characteristics. Thus, its price follows similar movements to the price of the underlying stock. In between these two extremes, the convertible bond trades like a hybrid instrument.",Valuation and Analysis of Bonds with Embedded Options,2024
"Investment firms are increasingly using technology at every step of the investment management value chain—from improving their understanding of clients to uncovering new sources of alpha and executing trades more efficiently. Machine learning techniques, a central part of that technology, are the subject of this reading. These techniques first appeared in finance in the 1990s and have since flourished with the explosion of data and cheap computing power. This reading provides a high-level view of machine learning (ML). It covers a selection of key ML algorithms and their investment applications. Investment practitioners should be equipped with a basic understanding of the types of investment problems that machine learning can address, an idea of how the algorithms work, and the vocabulary to interact with machine learning and data science experts. While investment practitioners need not master the details and mathematics of machine learning, as domain experts in investments they can play an important role in the implementation of these techniques by being able to source appropriate model inputs, interpret model outputs, and translate outputs into appropriate investment actions. Section 1 gives an overview of machine learning in investment management. Section 2 defines machine learning and the types of problems that can be addressed by supervised and unsupervised learning. Section 3 describes evaluating machine learning algorithm performance. Key supervised machine learning algorithms are covered in Sections 4–8, and Sections 9–12 describe key unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Neural networks, deep learning nets, and reinforcement learning are covered in Sections 13 and 14. Section 15 provides a decision flowchart for selecting the appropriate ML algorithm. The reading concludes with a summary.","The member should be able to: describe supervised machine learning, unsupervised machine learning, and deep learning; describe overfitting and identify methods of addressing it; describe supervised machine learning algorithms—including penalized regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, classification and regression tree, ensemble learning, and random forest—and determine the problems for which they are best suited; describe unsupervised machine learning algorithms—including principal components analysis, k-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering—and determine the problems for which they are best suited; describe neural networks, deep learning nets, and reinforcement learning",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R6_machine_learning.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/machine-learning,"Machine learning methods are gaining usage at many stages in the investment management value chain. Among the major points made are the following: Machine learning aims at extracting knowledge from large amounts of data by learning from known examples to determine an underlying structure in the data. The emphasis is on generating structure or predictions without human intervention. An elementary way to think of ML algorithms is to find the pattern, apply the pattern. Supervised learning depends on having labeled training data as well as matched sets of observed inputs (Xs, or features) and the associated output (Y, or target). Supervised learning can be divided into two categories: regression and classification. If the target variable to be predicted is continuous, then the task is one of regression. If the target variable is categorical or ordinal (e.g., determining a firms rating), then it is a classification problem. With unsupervised learning, algorithms are trained with no labeled data, so they must infer relations between features, summarize them, or present underlying structure in their distributions that has not been explicitly provided. Two important types of problems well suited to unsupervised ML are dimension reduction and clustering. In deep learning, sophisticated algorithms address complex tasks (e.g., image classification, natural language processing). Deep learning is based on neural networks, highly flexible ML algorithms for solving a variety of supervised and unsupervised tasks characterized by large datasets, non-linearities, and interactions among features. In reinforcement learning, a computer learns from interacting with itself or data generated by the same algorithm. Generalization describes the degree to which an ML model retains its explanatory power when predicting out-of-sample. Overfitting, a primary reason for lack of generalization, is the tendency of ML algorithms to tailor models to the training data at the expense of generalization to new data points. Bias error is the degree to which a model fits the training data. Variance error describes how much a models results change in response to new data from validation and test samples. Base error is due to randomness in the data. Out-of-sample error equals bias error plus variance error plus base error. K-fold cross-validation is a technique for mitigating the holdout sample problem (excessive reduction of the training set size). The data (excluding test sample and fresh data) are shuffled randomly and then divided into k equal sub-samples, with k – 1 samples used as training samples and one sample, the kth, used as a validation sample. Regularization describes methods that reduce statistical variability in high-dimensional data estimation or prediction problems via reducing model complexity. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) is a popular type of penalized regression where the penalty term involves summing the absolute values of the regression coefficients. The greater the number of included features, the larger the penalty. So, a feature must make a sufficient contribution to model fit to offset the penalty from including it. Support vector machine (SVM) is a classifier that aims to seek the optimal hyperplane—the one that separates the two sets of data points by the maximum margin (and thus is typically used for classification). K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a supervised learning technique most often used for classification. The idea is to classify a new observation by finding similarities (nearness) between it and its k-nearest neighbors in the existing dataset. Classification and regression tree (CART) can be applied to predict either a categorical target variable, producing a classification tree, or a continuous target variable, producing a regression tree. A binary CART is a combination of an initial root node, decision nodes, and terminal nodes. The root node and each decision node represent a single feature (f) and a cutoff value (c) for that feature. The CART algorithm iteratively partitions the data into sub-groups until terminal nodes are formed that contain the predicted label. Ensemble learning is a technique of combining the predictions from a collection of models. It typically produces more accurate and more stable predictions than any single model. A random forest classifier is a collection of many different decision trees generated by a bagging method or by randomly reducing the number of features available during training. Principal components analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised ML algorithm that reduces highly correlated features into fewer uncorrelated composite variables by transforming the feature covariance matrix. PCA produces eigenvectors that define the principal components (i.e., the new uncorrelated composite variables) and eigenvalues, which give the proportion of total variance in the initial data that is explained by each eigenvector and its associated principal component. K-means is an unsupervised ML algorithm that partitions observations into a fixed number (k) of non-overlapping clusters. Each cluster is characterized by its centroid, and each observation belongs to the cluster with the centroid to which that observation is closest. Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised iterative algorithm that is used to build a hierarchy of clusters. Two main strategies are used to define the intermediary clusters (i.e., those clusters between the initial dataset and the final set of clustered data). Agglomerative (bottom-up) hierarchical clustering begins with each observation being its own cluster. Then, the algorithm finds the two closest clusters, defined by some measure of distance, and combines them into a new, larger cluster. This process is repeated until all observations are clumped into a single cluster. Divisive (top-down) hierarchical clustering starts with all observations belonging to a single cluster. The observations are then divided into two clusters based on some measure of distance. The algorithm then progressively partitions the intermediate clusters into smaller clusters until each cluster contains only one observation. Neural networks consist of nodes connected by links. They have three types of layers: an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Learning takes place in the hidden layer nodes, each of which consists of a summation operator and an activation function. Neural networks have been successfully applied to a variety of investment tasks characterized by non-linearities and complex interactions among variables. Neural networks with many hidden layers (at least 2 but often more than 20) are known as deep neural networks (DNNs) and are the backbone of the artificial intelligence revolution. Reinforcement learning (RL) involves an agent that should perform actions that will maximize its rewards over time, taking into consideration the constraints of its environment.

"Among the most familiar and widely used valuation tools are price and enterprise value multiples. Price multiples are ratios of a stocks market price to some measure of fundamental value per share. Enterprise value multiples, by contrast, relate the total market value of all sources of a companys capital to a measure of fundamental value for the entire company. The intuition behind price multiples is that investors evaluate the price of a share of stock—judge whether it is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued—by considering what a share buys in terms of per share earnings, net assets, cash flow, or some other measure of value (stated on a per share basis). The intuition behind enterprise value multiples is similar; investors evaluate the market value of an entire enterprise relative to the amount of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), sales, or operating cash flow it generates. As valuation indicators (measures or indicators of value), multiples have the appealing qualities of simplicity in use and ease in communication. A multiple summarizes in a single number the relationship between the market value of a companys stock (or of its total capital) and some fundamental quantity, such as earnings, sales, or book value (owners equity based on accounting values). Among the questions we will study for answers that will help in making correct use of multiples as valuation tools are the following: What accounting issues affect particular price and enterprise value multiples, and how can analysts address them? How do price multiples relate to fundamentals, such as earnings growth rates, and how can analysts use this information when making valuation comparisons among stocks? For which types of valuation problems is a particular price or enterprise value multiple appropriate or inappropriate? What challenges arise in applying price and enterprise value multiples internationally? Multiples may be viewed as valuation indicators relating to individual securities. Another type of valuation indicator used in security selection is momentum indicators. They typically relate either price or a fundamental (such as earnings) to the time series of its own past values or, in some cases, to its expected value. The logic behind the use of momentum indicators is that such indicators may provide information on future patterns of returns over some time horizon. Because the purpose of momentum indicators is to identify potentially rewarding investment opportunities, they can be viewed as a class of valuation indicators with a focus that is different from and complementary to the focus of price and enterprise value multiples. We first put the use of price and enterprise value multiples in an economic context and present certain themes common to the use of any price or enterprise value multiple. We then present price multiples. The treatment of each multiple follows a common format: usage considerations, the relationship of the multiple to investors expectations about fundamentals, and using the multiple in valuation based on comparables. The subsequent sections present enterprise value multiples, international considerations in using multiples, and treatment of momentum indicators. We then discuss several practical issues that arise in using valuation indicators.","The member should be able to: distinguish between the method of comparables and the method based on forecasted fundamentals as approaches to using price multiples in valuation and explain economic rationales for each approach; calculate and interpret a justified price multiple; describe rationales for and possible drawbacks to using alternative price multiples and dividend yield in valuation; calculate and interpret alternative price multiples and dividend yield; calculate and interpret underlying earnings, explain methods of normalizing earnings per share (EPS), and calculate normalized EPS; explain and justify the use of earnings yield (E/P); describe fundamental factors that influence alternative price multiples and dividend yield; calculate and interpret the justified price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-book ratio (P/B), and price-to-sales ratio (P/S) for a stock, based on forecasted fundamentals; calculate and interpret a predicted P/E, given a cross-sectional regression on fundamentals, and explain limitations to the cross-sectional regression methodology; evaluate a stock by the method of comparables and explain the importance of fundamentals in using the method of comparables; calculate and interpret the P/E-to-growth (PEG) ratio and explain its use in relative valuation; calculate and explain the use of price multiples in determining terminal value in a multistage discounted cash flow (DCF) model; explain alternative definitions of cash flow used in price and enterprise value (EV) multiples and describe limitations of each definition; calculate and interpret EV multiples and evaluate the use of EV/EBITDA; explain sources of differences in cross-border valuation comparisons; describe momentum indicators and their use in valuation; explain the use of the arithmetic mean, the harmonic mean, the weighted harmonic mean, and the median to describe the central tendency of a group of multiples; and evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on comparisons of multiples.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R2_market_based_valuation.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/market-based-valuation-price-enterprise-value-multiples,"We have defined and explained the most important valuation indicators in professional use and illustrated their application to a variety of valuation problems. Price multiples are ratios of a stocks price to some measure of value per share. Price multiples are most frequently applied to valuation in the method of comparables. This method involves using a price multiple to evaluate whether an asset is relatively undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued in relation to a benchmark value of the multiple. The benchmark value of the multiple may be the multiple of a similar company or the median or average value of the multiple for a peer group of companies, an industry, an economic sector, an equity index, or the companys own median or average past values of the multiple. The economic rationale for the method of comparables is the law of one price. Price multiples may also be applied to valuation in the method based on forecasted fundamentals. Discounted cash flow (DCF) models provide the basis and rationale for this method. Fundamentals also interest analysts who use the method of comparables because differences between a price multiple and its benchmark value may be explained by differences in fundamentals. The key idea behind the use of price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) is that earning power is a chief driver of investment value and earnings per share (EPS) is probably the primary focus of security analysts attention. The EPS figure, however, is frequently subject to distortion, often volatile, and sometimes negative. The two alternative definitions of P/E are trailing P/E, based on the most recent four quarters of EPS, and forward P/E, based on next years expected earnings. Analysts address the problem of cyclicality by normalizing EPS—that is, calculating the level of EPS that the business could achieve currently under mid-cyclical conditions (normalized EPS). Two methods to normalize EPS are the method of historical average EPS (calculated over the most recent full cycle) and the method of average return on equity (EPS = average ROE multiplied by current book value per share). Earnings yield (E/P) is the reciprocal of the P/E. When stocks have zero or negative EPS, a ranking by earnings yield is meaningful whereas a ranking by P/E is not. Historical trailing P/Es should be calculated with EPS lagged a sufficient amount of time to avoid look-ahead bias. The same principle applies to other multiples calculated on a trailing basis. The fundamental drivers of P/E are the expected earnings growth rate and the required rate of return. The justified P/E based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first factor and an inverse relationship to the second factor. The PEG (P/E-to-growth) ratio is a tool to incorporate the impact of earnings growth on P/E. The PEG ratio is calculated as the ratio of the P/E to the consensus growth forecast. Stocks with low PEG ratios are, all else equal, more attractive than stocks with high PEG ratios. We can estimate terminal value in multistage DCF models by using price multiples based on comparables. The expression for terminal value, Vn , is (using P/E as the example) Vn = Benchmark value of trailing P/E × En or Vn = Benchmark value of forward P/E × En +1. Book value per share is intended to represent, on a per-share basis, the investment that common shareholders have in the company. Inflation, technological change, and accounting distortions, however, may impair the use of book value for this purpose. Book value is calculated as common shareholders equity divided by the number of shares outstanding. Analysts adjust book value to accurately reflect the value of the shareholders investment and to make P/B (the price-to-book ratio) more useful for comparing different stocks. The fundamental drivers of P/B are ROE and the required rate of return. The justified P/B based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first factor and an inverse relationship to the second factor. An important rationale for using the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) is that sales, as the top line in an income statement, are generally less subject to distortion or manipulation than other fundamentals, such as EPS or book value. Sales are also more stable than earnings and are never negative. P/S fails to take into account differences in cost structure between businesses, may not properly reflect the situation of companies losing money, and may be subject to manipulation through revenue recognition practices. The fundamental drivers of P/S are profit margin, growth rate, and the required rate of return. The justified P/S based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first two factors and an inverse relationship to the third factor. Enterprise value (EV) is total company value (the market value of debt, common equity, and preferred equity) minus the value of cash and investments. The ratio of EV to total sales is conceptually preferable to P/S because EV/S facilitates comparisons among companies with varying capital structures. A key idea behind the use of price to cash flow is that cash flow is less subject to manipulation than are earnings. Price-to-cash-flow multiples are often more stable than P/Es. Some common approximations to cash flow from operations have limitations, however, because they ignore items that may be subject to manipulation. The major cash flow (and related) concepts used in multiples are earnings plus noncash charges (CF), cash flow from operations (CFO), free cash flow to equity (FCFE), and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). In calculating price to cash flow, the earnings-plus-noncash-charges concept is traditionally used, although FCFE has the strongest link to financial theory. CF and EBITDA are not strictly cash flow numbers because they do not account for noncash revenue and net changes in working capital. The fundamental drivers of price to cash flow, however defined, are the expected growth rate of future cash flow and the required rate of return. The justified price to cash flow based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first factor and an inverse relationship to the second. EV/EBITDA is preferred to P/EBITDA because EBITDA, as a pre-interest number, is a flow to all providers of capital. EV/EBITDA may be more appropriate than P/E for comparing companies with different amounts of financial leverage (debt). EV/EBITDA is frequently used in the valuation of capital-intensive businesses. The fundamental drivers of EV/EBITDA are the expected growth rate in free cash flow to the firm, profitability, and the weighted average cost of capital. The justified EV/EBITDA based on fundamentals bears a positive relationship to the first two factors and an inverse relationship to the third. Dividend yield has been used as a valuation indicator because it is a component of total return and is less risky than capital appreciation. Trailing dividend yield is calculated as four times the most recent quarterly per-share dividend divided by the current market price. The fundamental drivers of dividend yield are the expected growth rate in dividends and the required rate of return. Comparing companies across borders frequently involves dealing with differences in accounting standards, cultural differences, economic differences, and resulting differences in risk and growth opportunities. Momentum indicators relate either price or a fundamental to the time series of the prices or fundamentals own past values (in some cases, to their expected values). Momentum valuation indicators include earnings surprise, standardized unexpected earnings (SUE), and relative strength. Unexpected earnings (or earnings surprise) equals the difference between reported earnings and expected earnings. SUE is unexpected earnings divided by the standard deviation in past unexpected earnings. Relative-strength indicators allow comparison of a stocks performance during a period either with its own past performance (first type) or with the performance of some group of stocks (second type). The rationale for using relative strength is the thesis that patterns of persistence or reversal in returns exist. Screening is the application of a set of criteria to reduce an investment universe to a smaller set of investments and is a part of many stock selection disciplines. In general, limitations of such screens include the lack of control in vendor-provided data of the calculation of important inputs and the absence of qualitative factors.",Market-Based Valuation: Price and Enterprise Value Multiples,2024
"In the upcoming sections, we present the characteristics and valuation of commodities and commodity derivatives. Given that investment in commodities is conducted primarily through futures markets, the concepts and theories behind commodity futures is a primary focus of the reading. In particular, the relationship between spot and futures prices, as well as the underlying components of futures returns, are key analytical considerations. What do we mean when we talk about investing in commodities? A basic economic definition is that a commodity is a physical good attributable to a natural resource that is tradable and supplied without substantial differentiation by the general public. Commodities trade in physical (spot) markets and in futures and forward markets. Spot markets involve the physical transfer of goods between buyers and sellers; prices in these markets reflect current (or very near term) supply and demand conditions. Global commodity futures markets constitute financial exchanges of standardized futures contracts in which a price is established in the market today for the sale of some defined quantity and quality of a commodity at a future date of delivery; completion of the contract may permit cash settlement or require physical delivery. Commodity futures exchanges allow for risk transfer and provide a valuable price discovery mechanism that reflects the collective views of all market participants with regard to the future supply and demand prospects of a commodity. Given the financial (versus physical) nature of their contract execution, commodity exchanges allow important parties beyond traditional suppliers and buyers—speculators, arbitrageurs, private equity, endowments, and other institutional investors—to participate in these price discovery and risk transfer processes. Standardized contracts and organized exchanges also offer liquidity (i.e., trading volumes) to facilitate closing, reducing, expanding, or opening new hedges or exposures as circumstances change on a daily basis. Forward markets exist alongside futures markets in certain commodities for use by entities that require customization in contract terms. Forwards are largely outside the scope of this reading and are discussed only briefly. Exposure to commodities is also traded in the swap markets for both speculative and hedging purposes. Investment managers may want to establish swap positions to match certain portfolio needs, whereas producers may want to more precisely adjust their commodity risk (e.g., the origin of their cattle or the chemical specifications of their crude oil). Commodities offer the potential for diversification benefits in a multi-asset class portfolio because of historically low average return correlation with stocks and bonds. In addition, certain academic studies (e.g., Gorton and Rouwenhorst 2006; Erb and Harvey 2006) demonstrate that some commodities have historically had inflation hedging qualities. Our coverage of the commodities topic is organized as follows: We provide an overview of physical commodity markets, including the major sectors, their life cycles, and their valuation. We then describe futures market participants, commodity futures pricing, and the analysis of commodity returns, including the concepts of contango and backwardation. The subsequent section reviews the use of swap instruments rather than futures to gain exposure to commodities. We then review the various commodity indexes given their importance as benchmarks for the asset class and investment vehicles. Finally, we conclude with a summary of the major points.","The member should be able to: compare characteristics of commodity sectors; compare the life cycle of commodity sectors from production through trading or consumption; contrast the valuation of commodities with the valuation of equities and bonds; describe types of participants in commodity futures markets; analyze the relationship between spot prices and futures prices in markets in contango and markets in backwardation; compare theories of commodity futures returns; describe, calculate, and interpret the components of total return for a fully collateralized commodity futures contract; contrast roll return in markets in contango and markets in backwardation; describe how commodity swaps are used to obtain or modify exposure to commodities; describe how the construction of commodity indexes affects index returns.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V5R3_intro_commodities_commodity_derivatives.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/introduction-commodities-commodity-derivatives,"Commodities are a diverse asset class comprising various sectors: energy, grains, industrial (base) metals, livestock, precious metals, and softs (cash crops). Each of these sectors has a number of characteristics that are important in determining the supply and demand for each commodity, including ease of storage, geopolitics, and weather. Fundamental analysis of commodities relies on analyzing supply and demand for each of the products as well as estimating the reaction to the inevitable shocks to their equilibrium or underlying direction. The life cycle of commodities varies considerably depending on the economic, technical, and structural (i.e., industry, value chain) profile of each commodity as well as the sector. A short life cycle allows for relatively rapid adjustment to outside events, whereas a long life cycle generally limits the ability of the market to react. The valuation of commodities relative to that of equities and bonds can be summarized by noting that equities and bonds represent financial assets whereas commodities are physical assets. The valuation of commodities is not based on the estimation of future profitability and cash flows but rather on a discounted forecast of future possible prices based on such factors as the supply and demand of the physical item. The commodity trading environment is similar to other asset classes, with three types of trading participants: (1) informed investors/hedgers, (2) speculators, and (3) arbitrageurs. Commodities have two general pricing forms: spot prices in the physical markets and futures prices for later delivery. The spot price is the current price to deliver or purchase a physical commodity at a specific location. A futures price is an exchange-based price agreed on to deliver or receive a defined quantity and often quality of a commodity at a future date. The difference between spot and futures prices is generally called the basis. When the spot price is higher than the futures price, it is called backwardation, and when it is lower, it is called contango. Backwardation and contango are also used to describe the relationship between two futures contracts of the same commodity. Commodity contracts can be settled by either cash or physical delivery. There are three primary theories of futures returns. In insurance theory, commodity producers who are long the physical good are motived to sell the commodity for future delivery to hedge their production price risk exposure. The hedging pressure hypothesis describes when producers along with consumers seek to protect themselves from commodity market price volatility by entering into price hedges to stabilize their projected profits and cash flow. The theory of storage focuses on supply and demand dynamics of commodity inventories, including the concept of convenience yield. The total return of a fully collateralized commodity futures contract can be quantified as the spot price return plus the roll return plus the collateral return (risk-free rate return). The roll return is effectively the weighted accounting difference (in percentage terms) between the near-term commodity futures contract price and the farther-term commodity futures contract price. A commodity swap is a legal contract between two parties calling for the exchange of payments over multiple dates as determined by several reference prices or indexes. The most relevant commodity swaps include excess return swaps, total return swaps, basis swaps, and variance/volatility swaps. The five primary commodity indexes based on assets are (1) the S&amp;P GSCI; (2) the Bloomberg Commodity Index, formerly the Dow Jones–UBS Commodity Index; (3) the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index; (4) the Thomson Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB Index; and (5) the Rogers International Commodities Index. The key differentiating characteristics of commodity indexes are the breadth and selection methodology of coverage (number of commodities and sectors) included in each index, noting that some commodities have multiple reference contracts, the relative weightings assigned to each component/commodity and the related methodology for how these weights are determined, the methodology and frequency for rolling the individual futures contracts, the methodology and frequency for rebalancing the weights of the individual commodities and sectors, and the governance that determines which commodities are selected.",Introduction to Commodities and Commodity Derivatives,2024
"A contingent claim is a derivative instrument that provides its owner a right but not an obligation to a payoff determined by an underlying asset, rate, or other derivative. Contingent claims include options, the valuation of which is the objective of this reading. Because many investments contain embedded options, understanding this material is vital for investment management. Our primary purpose is to understand how the values of options are determined. Option values, as with the values of all financial instruments, are typically obtained using valuation models. Any financial valuation model takes certain inputs and turns them into an output that tells us the fair value or price. Option valuation models, like their counterparts in the forward, futures, and swaps markets, are based on the principle of no arbitrage, meaning that the appropriate price of an option is the one that makes it impossible for any party to earn an arbitrage profit at the expense of any other party. The price that precludes arbitrage profits is the value of the option. Using that concept, we then proceed to introduce option valuation models using two approaches. The first approach is the binomial model, which is based on discrete time, and the second is the Black–Scholes–Merton (BSM) model, which is based on continuous time. The reading is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the principles of the no-arbitrage approach to pricing and valuation of options. In Section 3, the binomial option valuation model is explored, and in Section 4, the BSM model is covered. In Section 5, the Black model, being a variation of the BSM model, is applied to futures options, interest rate options, and swaptions. Finally, in Section 6, the Greeks are reviewed along with implied volatility. Section 7 provides a summary.",The member should be able to: describe and interpret the binomial option valuation model and its component terms; calculate the no-arbitrage values of European and American options using a two-period binomial model; identify an arbitrage opportunity involving options and describe the related arbitrage; calculate and interpret the value of an interest rate option using a two-period binomial model; describe how the value of a European option can be analyzed as the present value of the options expected payoff at expiration; identify assumptions of the Black–Scholes–Merton option valuation model; interpret the components of the Black–Scholes–Merton model as applied to call options in terms of a leveraged position in the underlying; describe how the Black–Scholes–Merton model is used to value European options on equities and currencies; describe how the Black model is used to value European options on futures; describe how the Black model is used to value European interest rate options and European swaptions; interpret each of the option Greeks; describe how a delta hedge is executed; describe the role of gamma risk in options trading; define implied volatility and explain how it is used in options trading.,Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V5R2_valuation_of_contingent_claims.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/valuation-contingent-claims,"This reading on the valuation of contingent claims provides a foundation for understanding how a variety of different options are valued. Key points include the following: The arbitrageur would rather have more money than less and abides by two fundamental rules: Do not use your own money and do not take any price risk. The no-arbitrage approach is used for option valuation and is built on the key concept of the law of one price, which says that if two investments have the same future cash flows regardless of what happens in the future, then these two investments should have the same current price. Throughout this reading, the following key assumptions are made: Replicating instruments are identifiable and investable. Market frictions are nil. Short selling is allowed with full use of proceeds. The underlying instrument price follows a known distribution. Borrowing and lending is available at a known risk-free rate. The two-period binomial model can be viewed as three one-period binomial models, one positioned at Time 0 and two positioned at Time 1. In general, European-style options can be valued based on the expectations approach in which the option value is determined as the present value of the expected future option payouts, where the discount rate is the risk-free rate and the expectation is taken based on the risk-neutral probability measure. Both American-style options and European-style options can be valued based on the no-arbitrage approach, which provides clear interpretations of the component terms; the option value is determined by working backward through the binomial tree to arrive at the correct current value. For American-style options, early exercise influences the option values and hedge ratios as one works backward through the binomial tree. Interest rate option valuation requires the specification of an entire term structure of interest rates, so valuation is often estimated via a binomial tree. A key assumption of the Black–Scholes–Merton option valuation model is that the return of the underlying instrument follows geometric Brownian motion, implying a lognormal distribution of the return. The BSM model can be interpreted as a dynamically managed portfolio of the underlying instrument and zero-coupon bonds. BSM model interpretations related to N(d1) are that it is the basis for the number of units of underlying instrument to replicate an option, that it is the primary determinant of delta, and that it answers the question of how much the option value will change for a small change in the underlying. BSM model interpretations related to N(d2) are that it is the basis for the number of zero-coupon bonds to acquire to replicate an option and that it is the basis for estimating the risk-neutral probability of an option expiring in the money. The Black futures option model assumes the underlying is a futures or a forward contract. Interest rate options can be valued based on a modified Black futures option model in which the underlying is a forward rate agreement (FRA), there is an accrual period adjustment as well as an underlying notional amount, and that care must be given to day-count conventions. An interest rate cap is a portfolio of interest rate call options termed caplets, each with the same exercise rate and with sequential maturities. An interest rate floor is a portfolio of interest rate put options termed floorlets, each with the same exercise rate and with sequential maturities. A swaption is an option on a swap. A payer swaption is an option on a swap to pay fixed and receive floating. A receiver swaption is an option on a swap to receive fixed and pay floating. Long a callable fixed-rate bond can be viewed as long a straight fixed-rate bond and short a receiver swaption. Delta is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio for a given small change in the value of the underlying instrument, holding everything else constant. Delta hedging refers to managing the portfolio delta by entering additional positions into the portfolio. A delta neutral portfolio is one in which the portfolio delta is set and maintained at zero. A change in the option price can be estimated with a delta approximation. Because delta is used to make a linear approximation of the non-linear relationship that exists between the option price and the underlying price, there is an error that can be estimated by gamma. Gamma is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio delta for a given small change in the value of the underlying instrument, holding everything else constant. Gamma captures the non-linearity risk or the risk—via exposure to the underlying—that remains once the portfolio is delta neutral. A gamma neutral portfolio is one in which the portfolio gamma is maintained at zero. The change in the option price can be better estimated by a delta-plus-gamma approximation compared with just a delta approximation. Theta is a static risk measure defined as the change in the value of an option given a small change in calendar time, holding everything else constant. Vega is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio for a given small change in volatility, holding everything else constant. Rho is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio for a given small change in the risk-free interest rate, holding everything else constant. Although historical volatility can be estimated, there is no objective measure of future volatility. Implied volatility is the BSM model volatility that yields the market option price. Implied volatility is a measure of future volatility, whereas historical volatility is a measure of past volatility. Option prices reflect the beliefs of option market participant about the future volatility of the underlying. The volatility smile is a two dimensional plot of the implied volatility with respect to the exercise price. The volatility surface is a three dimensional plot of the implied volatility with respect to both expiration time and exercise prices. If the BSM model assumptions were true, then one would expect to find the volatility surface flat, but in practice, the volatility surface is not flat.",Valuation of Contingent Claims,2024
"Common stock represents an ownership interest in a business. A business in its operations generates a stream of cash flows, and as owners of the business, common stockholders have an equity ownership claim on those future cash flows. Beginning with John Burr Williams (1938), analysts have developed this insight into a group of valuation models known as discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation models. DCF models—which view the intrinsic value of common stock as the present value of its expected future cash flows—are a fundamental tool in both investment management and investment research. Although the principles behind discounted cash flow valuation are simple, applying the theory to equity valuation can be challenging. Four broad steps in applying DCF analysis to equity valuation are: choosing the class of DCF model—equivalently, selecting a specific definition of cash flow; forecasting the cash flows; choosing a discount rate methodology; and estimating the discount rate. In our coverage of this topic, we take the perspective that dividends—distributions to shareholders authorized by a companys board of directors—are an appropriate definition of cash flows. The class of models based on this idea is called dividend discount models, or DDMs. The basic objective of any DDM is to value a stock. The variety of implementations corresponds to different ways to model a companys future stream of dividend payments. The steps of choosing a discount rate methodology and estimating the discount rate involve the same considerations for all DCF models, so they have been presented separately in an earlier discussion. The sections are organized as follows: We first provide an overview of present value models. We then provide a general statement of the dividend discount model. Forecasting dividends, individually and in detail, into the indefinite future is not generally practicable, so the dividend-forecasting problem is usually simplified. One approach is to assign dividends to a stylized growth pattern. In the subsequent section, we focus on the simplest pattern—dividends growing at a constant rate forever (the constant growth or Gordon growth model). We then explain that for some companies, it is more appropriate to view earnings and dividends as having multiple stages of growth. We present multistage dividend discount models along with spreadsheet modeling.

In DCF models, the value of any asset is the present value of its (expected) future cash flows V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n CF t ( 1 + r ) t , where V 0 is the value of the asset as of t = 0 (today), CF t is the (expected) cash flow at time t, and r is the discount rate or required rate of return. For infinitely lived assets such as common stocks, n runs to infinity. Several alternative streams of expected cash flows can be used to value equities, including dividends, free cash flow, and residual income. A discounted dividend approach is most suitable for dividend-paying stocks in which the company has a discernible dividend policy that has an understandable relationship to the companys profitability and the investor has a non-control (minority ownership) perspective. The free cash flow approach (FCFF or FCFE) might be appropriate when the company does not pay dividends, dividends differ substantially from FCFE, free cash flows align with profitability, or the investor takes a control (majority ownership) perspective. The residual income approach can be useful when the company does not pay dividends (as an alternative to a FCF approach) or free cash flow is negative. The DDM with a single holding period gives stock value as V 0 = D 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 = D 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 , where D 1 is the expected dividend at Time 1 and V 0 is the stocks (expected) value at Time 0. Assuming that V 0 is equal to todays market price, P 0, the expected holding-period return is r = D 1 + P 1 P 0 − 1 = D 1 P 0 + P 1 − P 0 P 0 . The expression for the DDM for any given finite holding period n and the general expression for the DDM are, respectively, V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n D t ( 1 + r ) t + P n ( 1 + r ) n and V 0 = ∑ t = 1 ∞ D t ( 1 + r ) t . There are two main approaches to the problem of forecasting dividends. First, an analyst can assign the entire stream of expected future dividends to one of several stylized growth patterns. Second, an analyst can forecast a finite number of dividends individually up to a terminal point and value the remaining dividends either by assigning them to a stylized growth pattern or by forecasting share price as of the terminal point of the dividend forecasts. The Gordon growth model assumes that dividends grow at a constant rate g forever, so that Dt = Dt– 1(1 + g). The dividend stream in the Gordon growth model has a value of V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) r − g , or V 0 = D 1 r − g where r &gt; g . The value of non-callable fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock is V 0 = D/r, where D is the stocks (constant) annual dividend. Assuming that price equals value, the Gordon growth model estimate of a stocks expected rate of return is r = D 0 ( 1 + g ) P 0 + g = D 1 P 0 + g . Given an estimate of the next-period dividend and the stocks required rate of return, the Gordon growth model can be used to estimate the dividend growth rate implied by the current market price (making a constant growth rate assumption). The present value of growth opportunities is the part of a stocks total value, V 0, that comes from profitable future growth opportunities in contrast to the value associated with assets already in place. The relationship is V 0 = E 1/r + PVGO, where E 1/r is defined as the no-growth value per share. The leading price-to-earnings ratio (P 0/E 1) and the trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P 0/E 0) can be expressed in terms of the Gordon growth model as, respectively, P 0 E 1 = D 1 / E 1 r − g = 1 − b r − g and P 0 E 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) / E 0 r − g = ( 1 − b ) ( 1 + g ) r − g . The foregoing expressions give a stocks justified price-to-earnings ratio based on forecasts of fundamentals (given that the Gordon growth model is appropriate). The Gordon growth model may be useful for valuing broad-based equity indexes and the stock of businesses with earnings that are expected to grow at a stable rate comparable to or lower than the economys nominal growth rate. Gordon growth model values are very sensitive to the assumed growth rate and required rate of return. For many companies, growth falls into phases. In the growth phase, a company enjoys an abnormally high growth rate in earnings per share, called supernormal growth. In the transition phase, earnings growth slows. In the mature phase, the company reaches an equilibrium in which such factors as earnings growth and the return on equity stabilize at levels that can be sustained long term. Analysts often apply multistage DCF models to value the stock of a company with multistage growth prospects. The two-stage dividend discount model assumes different growth rates in Stage 1 and Stage 2: V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n D 0 ( 1 + g S ) t ( 1 + r ) t + D 0 ( 1 + g S ) n ( 1 + g L ) ( 1 + r ) n ( r − g L ) , where gS is the expected dividend growth rate in the first period and gL is the expected growth rate in the second period. The terminal stock value, Vn , is sometimes found with the Gordon growth model or with some other method, such as applying a P/E multiplier to forecasted EPS as of the terminal date. The H-model assumes that the dividend growth rate declines linearly from a high supernormal rate to the normal growth rate during Stage 1 and then grows at a constant normal growth rate thereafter: V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) r − g L + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L . There are two basic three-stage models. In one version, the growth rate in the middle stage is constant. In the second version, the growth rate declines linearly in Stage 2 and becomes constant and normal in Stage 3. In addition to valuing equities, the IRR of a DDM, assuming assets are correctly priced in the marketplace, has been used to estimate required returns. For simpler models (such as the one-period model, the Gordon growth model, and the H-model), well-known formulas may be used to calculate these rates of return. For many dividend streams, however, the rate of return must be found by trial and error, producing a discount rate that equates the present value of the forecasted dividend stream to the current market price. Multistage DDM models can accommodate a wide variety of patterns of expected dividends. Even though such models may use stylized assumptions about growth, they can provide useful approximations. Dividend growth rates can be obtained from analyst forecasts, statistical forecasting models, or company fundamentals. The sustainable growth rate depends on the ROE and the earnings retention rate, b: g = b × ROE. This expression can be expanded further, using the DuPont formula, as g = Net income − Dividends Net income × Net income Sales × Sales Total assets × Total assets Shareholders equity .",Discounted Dividend Valuation,2024
"Regulation can be described as a form of government intervention in markets that involves rules and their enforcement. It is an important topic because regulation has potential effects not only at the macro level on the economy but also at the micro level on companies and individuals. Regulation may develop either proactively in anticipation of consequences of changes in the market environment or reactively in response to some occurrence(s). For example, changes that resulted from technological advances in the markets because of new means of communication and applications of computers have led to a variety of regulation, both proactive and reactive. Regulation has also developed in response to financial crises and undesirable behaviors or actions that have occurred in the past. Regulations are necessary because in some situations market solutions are inadequate. In other words, regulations exist to protect end users from market failings. A significant challenge for financial regulators is how to deal with systemic risk (the risk of failure of the financial system) and the consequences of risk taking by financial institutions. Issues such as labor regulation, environmental regulation, and electronic privacy are also receiving increased attention. How regulations are developed and applied can have significant impacts on businesses. Changes in regulatory framework and regulatory uncertainty can also have substantial effects on business decisions. So, one of the significant challenges facing professionals in the finance industry is to anticipate and understand the consequences of potential changes in the regulatory environment and of specific regulations. In the following sections, we describe the economic rationale of regulation, including how regulation improves fairness in markets and addresses the danger to society of financial system failure. We also provide an overview of regulators, the tools at their disposal, and how the work of regulators around the globe is interdependent. Lastly, we describe the assessment of costs and benefits of regulation and highlight practical issues that arise from the implementation of regulation.",The member should be able to: describe the economic rationale for regulatory intervention; explain the purposes of regulating commerce and financial markets; describe anticompetitive behaviors targeted by antitrust laws globally and evaluate the antitrust risk associated with a given business strategy; describe classifications of regulations and regulators; describe uses of self-regulation in financial markets; describe regulatory interdependencies and their effects; describe tools of regulatory intervention in markets; describe benefits and costs of regulation; describe the considerations when evaluating the effects of regulation on an industry.,Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R11_economics_of_regulation.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/economics-regulation,"Knowledge of regulation is important because regulation has potentially far-reaching and significant effects. These effects can range from macro-level effects on the economy to micro-level effects on individual entities and securities. Regulation originates from a variety of sources and in a variety of areas. A framework that includes types of regulators and regulation as well as areas of regulation that may affect the entity of interest (including the economy as an entity) is useful. The framework will help in assessing possible effects of new regulation. It can also help in assessing the effects of regulation on various entities. More than one regulator may develop regulations in response to a particular issue. Each of the relevant regulators may have different objectives and choose to address the issue using different regulatory tools. In developing regulations, the regulator should consider costs and benefits. In the analysis, the net regulatory burden (private costs less private benefits of regulation) may also be relevant. Potential costs and benefits, regardless of the perspective, may be difficult to assess. A critical aspect of regulatory analysis, however, is assessing the costs and benefits of regulation. The following are some key points of the reading. The existence of informational frictions and externalities creates a need for regulation. Regulation is expected to have societal benefits and should be assessed using cost–benefit analysis. The regulation of securities markets and financial institutions is extensive and complex because of the consequences of failures in the financial system. These consequences include financial losses, loss of confidence, and disruption of commerce. The focus of regulators in financial markets includes prudential supervision, financial stability, market integrity, and economic growth. Regulatory competition is competition among different regulatory bodies to use regulation in order to attract certain entities. The breadth of regulation of commerce necessitates the use of a framework that identifies potential areas of regulation. This framework can be referenced to identify specific areas of regulation, both existing and anticipated, that may affect the entity of interest. Legislative bodies, regulatory bodies, and courts typically enact regulation. Regulatory bodies include government agencies and independent regulators granted authority by a government or governmental agency. Some independent regulators are self-regulating organizations. Typically, legislative bodies enact broad laws or statutes. Regulatory bodies issue administrative regulations, often implementing statutes. Courts interpret statutes and administrative regulations; these interpretations may result in judicial law. Interdependence in the actions and potentially conflicting objectives of regulators is an important consideration for regulators, regulated entities, and those assessing the effects of regulation. Regulation that arises to enhance the interests of regulated entities reflects regulatory capture. Regulators have responsibility for both substantive and procedural laws. The former focuses on rights and responsibilities of entities and relationships among entities. The latter focuses on the protection and enforcement of the former. Regulatory arbitrage is the use of regulation by an entity to exploit differences in economic substance and regulatory interpretation or in regulatory regimes to the entitys benefit. There are many regulatory tools available to regulators, including regulatory mandates and restrictions on behaviors, provision of public goods, and public financing of private projects. The choice of regulatory tool should be consistent with maintaining a stable regulatory environment. Stable does not mean unchanging but, rather, refers to desirable attributes of regulation, including predictability, effectiveness in achieving objectives, time consistency, and enforceability. In assessing regulation and regulatory outcomes, regulators should conduct ongoing cost–benefit analyses, develop techniques to enhance the measurement of these outcomes, and use economic principles to guide them. Net regulatory burden to the entity of interest is an important consideration for analysts.",Economics of Regulation,2024
"Exchange rates are well known to follow a random walk, whereby fluctuations from one day to the next are unpredictable. The business of currency forecasting can be a humbling experience. Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, famously noted that having endeavored to forecast exchange rates for more than half a century, I have understandably developed significant humility about my ability in this area. Hence, our discussion is not about predicting exchange rates but about the tools the reader can use to better understand long-run equilibrium value. This outlook helps guide the market participants decisions with respect to risk exposures, as well as whether currency hedges should be implemented and, if so, how they should be managed. After discussing the basics of exchange rate transactions, we present the main theories for currency determination—starting with the international parity conditions—and then describe other important influences, such as current account balances, capital flows, and monetary and fiscal policy. Although these fundamentals-based models usually perform poorly in predicting future exchange rates in the short run, they are crucial for understanding long-term currency value. Thus, we proceed as follows: We review the basic concepts of the foreign exchange market covered in the CFA Program Level I curriculum and expand this previous coverage to incorporate more material on bid–offer spreads. We then begin to examine determinants of exchange rates, starting with longer-term interrelationships among exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation rates embodied in the international parity conditions. These parity conditions form the key building blocks for many long-run exchange rate models. We also examine the foreign exchange (FX) carry trade, a trading strategy that exploits deviations from uncovered interest rate parity and discuss the relationship between a countrys exchange rate and its balance of payments. We then examine how monetary and fiscal policies can indirectly affect exchange rates by influencing the various factors described in our exchange rate model. The subsequent section focuses on direct public sector actions in foreign exchange markets, both through capital controls and by foreign exchange market intervention (buying and selling currencies for policy purposes). The last section examines historical episodes of currency crisis and some leading indicators that may signal the increased likelihood of a crisis. We conclude with a summary.","The member should be able to: calculate and interpret the bid–offer spread on a spot or forward currency quotation and describe the factors that affect the bid–offer spread; identify a triangular arbitrage opportunity and calculate its profit, given the bid–offer quotations for three currencies; distinguish between spot and forward rates and calculate the forward premium/discount for a given currency; calculate the mark-to-market value of a forward contract; explain international parity conditions (covered and uncovered interest rate parity, forward rate parity, purchasing power parity, and the international Fisher effect); describe relations among the international parity conditions; evaluate the use of the current spot rate, the forward rate, purchasing power parity, and uncovered interest parity to forecast future spot exchange rates; explain approaches to assessing the long-run fair value of an exchange rate; describe the carry trade and its relation to uncovered interest rate parity and calculate the profit from a carry trade; explain how flows in the balance of payment accounts affect currency exchange rates; explain the potential effects of monetary and fiscal policy on exchange rates; describe objectives of central bank or government intervention and capital controls and describe the effectiveness of intervention and capital controls; describe warning signs of a currency crisis.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R9_currency_exchange_rates_equilibrium_value.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/currency-exchange-rates-understanding-equilibrium-value,"Exchange rates are among the most difficult financial market prices to understandand therefore to value. There is no simple, robust framework that investors can relyon in assessing the appropriate level and likely movements of exchange rates.Most economists believe that there is an equilibrium level or a path to that equilibriumvalue that a currency will gravitate toward in the long run. Although short- and medium-termcyclical deviations from the long-run equilibrium path can be sizable and persistent,fundamental forces should eventually drive the currency back toward its long-run equilibriumpath. Evidence suggests that misalignments tend to build up gradually over time. Asthese misalignments build, they are likely to generate serious economic imbalancesthat will eventually lead to correction of the underlying exchange rate misalignment.We have described how changes in monetary policy, fiscal policy, current account trends,and capital flows affect exchange rate trends, as well as what role government interventionand capital controls can play in counteracting potentially undesirable exchange ratemovements. We have made the following key points: Spot exchange rates apply to trades for the next settlement date (usually T + 2) for a given currency pair. Forward exchange rates apply to trades to be settled at any longer maturity. Market makers quote bid and offer prices (in terms of the price currency) at which they will buy or sell the base currency. The offer price is always higher than the bid price. The counterparty that asks for a two-sided price quote has the option (but not the obligation) to deal at either the bid or offer price quoted. The bid–offer spread depends on (1) the currency pair involved, (2) the time of day, (3) market volatility, (4) the transaction size, and (5) the relationship between the dealer and the client. Spreads are tightest in highly liquid currency pairs, when the key market centers are open, and when market volatility is relatively low. Absence of arbitrage requires the following: The bid (offer) shown by a dealer in the interbank market cannot be higher (lower) than the current interbank offer (bid) price. The cross-rate bids (offers) posted by a dealer must be lower (higher) than the implied cross-rate offers (bids) available in the interbank market. If they are not, then a triangular arbitrage opportunity arises. Forward exchange rates are quoted in terms of points to be added to the spot exchange rate. If the points are positive (negative), the base currency is trading at a forward premium (discount). The points are proportional to the interest rate differential and approximately proportional to the time to maturity. International parity conditions show us how expected inflation, interest rate differentials, forward exchange rates, and expected future spot exchange rates are linked. In an ideal world, relative expected inflation rates should determine relative nominal interest rates, relative interest rates should determine forward exchange rates, and forward exchange rates should correctly anticipate the path of the future spot exchange rate. International parity conditions tell us that countries with high (low) expected inflation rates should see their currencies depreciate (appreciate) over time, that high-yield currencies should depreciate relative to low-yield currencies over time, and that forward exchange rates should function as unbiased predictors of future spot exchange rates. With the exception of covered interest rate parity, which is enforced by arbitrage, the key international parity conditions rarely hold in either the short or medium term. However, the parity conditions tend to hold over relatively long horizons. According to the theory of covered interest rate parity, a foreign-currency-denominated money market investment that is completely hedged against exchange rate risk in the forward market should yield exactly the same return as an otherwise identical domestic money market investment. According to the theory of uncovered interest rate parity, the expected change in a domestic currencys value should be fully reflected in domestic–foreign interest rate spreads. Hence, an unhedged foreign-currency-denominated money market investment is expected to yield the same return as an otherwise identical domestic money market investment. According to the ex ante purchasing power parity condition, expected changes in exchange rates should equal the difference in expected national inflation rates. If both ex ante purchasing power parity and uncovered interest rate parity held, real interest rates across all markets would be the same. This result is real interest rate parity. The international Fisher effect says that the nominal interest rate differential between two currencies equals the difference between the expected inflation rates. The international Fisher effect assumes that risk premiums are the same throughout the world. If both covered and uncovered interest rate parity held, then forward rate parity would hold and the market would set the forward exchange rate equal to the expected spot exchange rate: The forward exchange rate would serve as an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Most studies have found that high-yield currencies do not depreciate and low-yield currencies do not appreciate as much as yield spreads would suggest over short to medium periods, thus violating the theory of uncovered interest rate parity. Carry trades overweight high-yield currencies at the expense of low-yield currencies. Historically, carry trades have generated attractive returns in benign market conditions but tend to perform poorly (i.e., are subject to crash risk) when market conditions are highly volatile. According to a balance of payments approach, countries that run persistent current account deficits will generally see their currencies weaken over time. Similarly, countries that run persistent current account surpluses will tend to see their currencies appreciate over time. Large current account imbalances can persist for long periods of time before they trigger an adjustment in exchange rates. Greater financial integration of the worlds capital markets and greater freedom of capital to flow across national borders have increased the importance of global capital flows in determining exchange rates. Countries that institute relatively tight monetary policies, introduce structural economic reforms, and lower budget deficits will often see their currencies strengthen over time as capital flows respond positively to relatively high nominal interest rates, lower inflation expectations, a lower risk premium, and an upward revision in the markets assessment of what exchange rate level constitutes long-run fair value. Monetary policy affects the exchange rate through a variety of channels. In the Mundell–Fleming model, it does so primarily through the interest rate sensitivity of capital flows, strengthening the currency when monetary policy is tightened and weakening it when monetary policy is eased. The more sensitive capital flows are to the change in interest rates, the greater the exchange rates responsiveness to the change in monetary policy. In the monetary model of exchange rate determination, monetary policy is deemed to have a direct impact on the actual and expected path of inflation, which, via purchasing power parity, translates into a corresponding impact on the exchange rate. Countries that pursue overly easy monetary policies will see their currencies depreciate over time. In the Mundell–Fleming model, an expansionary fiscal policy typically results in a rise in domestic interest rates and an increase in economic activity. The rise in domestic interest rates should induce a capital inflow, which is positive for the domestic currency, but the rise in economic activity should contribute to a deterioration of the trade balance, which is negative for the domestic currency. The more mobile capital flows are, the greater the likelihood that the induced inflow of capital will dominate the deterioration in trade. Under conditions of high capital mobility, countries that simultaneously pursue expansionary fiscal policies and relatively tight monetary policies should see their currencies strengthen over time. The portfolio balance model of exchange rate determination asserts that increases in government debt resulting from a rising budget deficit will be willingly held by investors only if they are compensated in the form of a higher expected return. The higher expected return could come from (1) higher interest rates and/or a higher risk premium, (2) depreciation of the currency to a level sufficient to generate anticipation of gains from subsequent currency appreciation, or (3) some combination of the two. Surges in capital inflows can fuel boom-like conditions, asset price bubbles, and currency overvaluation. Many consider capital controls to be a legitimate part of a policymakers toolkit. The IMF believes that capital controls may be needed to prevent exchange rates from overshooting, asset price bubbles from forming, and future financial conditions from deteriorating. The evidence indicates that government policies have had a significant impact on the course of exchange rates. Relative to developed countries, emerging markets may have greater success in managing their exchange rates because of their large foreign exchange reserve holdings, which appear sizable relative to the limited turnover of FX transactions in many emerging markets. Although each currency crisis is distinct in some respects, the following factors were identified in one or more studies: Prior to a currency crisis, the capital markets have been liberalized to allow the free flow of capital. There are large inflows of foreign capital (relative to GDP) in the period leading up to a crisis, with short-term funding denominated in a foreign currency being particularly problematic. Currency crises are often preceded by (and often coincide with) banking crises. Countries with fixed or partially fixed exchange rates are more susceptible to currency crises than countries with floating exchange rates. Foreign exchange reserves tend to decline precipitously as a crisis approaches. In the period leading up to a crisis, the currency has risen substantially relative to its historical mean. The terms of trade (exports relative to imports) often deteriorate before a crisis. Broad money growth and the ratio of M2 (a measure of money supply) to bank reserves tend to rise prior to a crisis. Inflation tends to be significantly higher in pre-crisis periods compared with tranquil periods.",Currency Exchange Rates: Understanding Equilibrium Value,2024
"Forecasts of long-run economic growth are important for global investors. Equity prices reflect expectations of the future stream of earnings, which depend on expectations of future economic activity. This dynamic means that in the long term, the same factors that drive economic growth will be reflected in equity values. Similarly, the expected long-run growth rate of real income is a key determinant of the average real interest rate level in the economy, and therefore the level of real returns in general. In the shorter term, the relationship between actual and potential growth (i.e., the degree of slack in the economy) is a key driver of fixed-income returns. Therefore, in order to develop global portfolio strategies and investment return expectations, investors must be able to identify and forecast the factors that drive long-term sustainable growth trends. Based on a countrys long-term economic outlook, investors can then evaluate the long-term investment potential and risk of investing in the securities of companies located or operating in that country. In contrast to the short-run fluctuations of the business cycle, the study of economic growth focuses on the long-run trend in aggregate output as measured by potential GDP. Over long periods, the actual growth rate of GDP should equal the rate of increase in potential GDP because, by definition, output in excess of potential GDP requires employing labor and capital beyond their optimum levels. Thus, the growth rate of potential GDP acts as an upper limit to growth and determines the economys sustainable rate of growth. Increasing the growth rate of potential GDP is the key to raising the level of income, the level of profits, and the living standard of the population. Even small differences in the growth rate translate into large differences in the level of income over time. What drives long-run growth? What distinguishes the winners from the losers in the long-run growth arena? Will poor countries catch up with rich countries over time? Can policies have a permanent effect on the sustainable growth rate? If so, how? If not, why not? These and other key questions are addressed in detail in this reading. We first examine the long-term growth record, focusing on the extent of growth variation across countries and across decades. We then discuss the importance of economic growth to global investors and examine the relationship between investment returns and economic growth. We next turn to the factors that determine long-run economic growth before presenting the classical, neoclassical, and endogenous growth models. We also discuss whether poorer countries are converging to the higher income levels of the richer countries. Finally, we look at the impact of international trade on economic growth.","The member should be able to: compare factors favoring and limiting economic growth in developed and developing economies; describe the relation between the long-run rate of stock market appreciation and the sustainable growth rate of the economy; explain why potential GDP and its growth rate matter for equity and fixed income investors; distinguish between capital deepening investment and technological progress and explain how each affects economic growth and labor productivity; forecast potential GDP based on growth accounting relations; explain how natural resources affect economic growth and evaluate the argument that limited availability of natural resources constrains economic growth; explain how demographics, immigration, and labor force participation affect the rate and sustainability of economic growth; explain how investment in physical capital, human capital, and technological development affects economic growth; compare classical growth theory, neoclassical growth theory, and endogenous growth theory; explain and evaluate convergence hypotheses; describe the economic rationale for governments to provide incentives to private investment in technology and knowledge; describe the expected impact of removing trade barriers on capital investment and profits, employment and wages, and growth in the economies involved.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R10_economic_growth.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/economic-growth,"This reading focuses on the factors that determine the long-term growth trend in the economy. As part of the development of global portfolio equity and fixed-income strategies, investors must be able to determine both the near-term and the sustainable rates of growth within a country. Doing so requires identifying and forecasting the factors that determine the level of GDP and that determine long-term sustainable trends in economic growth. The sustainable rate of economic growth is measured by the rate of increase in the economys productive capacity or potential GDP. Growth in real GDP measures how rapidly the total economy is expanding. Per capita GDP, defined as real GDP divided by population, measures the standard of living in each country. The growth rate of real GDP and the level of per capita real GDP vary widely among countries. As a result, investment opportunities differ by country. Equity markets respond to anticipated growth in earnings. Higher sustainable economic growth should lead to higher earnings growth and equity market valuation ratios, all other things being equal. The best estimate for the long-term growth in earnings for a given country is the estimate of the growth rate in potential GDP. In the long run, the growth rate of earnings cannot exceed the growth in potential GDP. Labor productivity is critical because it affects the level of the upper limit. A permanent increase in productivity growth will raise the upper limit on earnings growth and should translate into faster long-run earnings growth and a corresponding increase in stock price appreciation. For global fixed-income investors, a critical macroeconomic variable is the rate of inflation. One of the best indicators of short- to intermediate-term inflation trends is the difference between the growth rate of actual and potential GDP. Capital deepening, an increase in the capital-to-labor ratio, occurs when the growth rate of capital (net investment) exceeds the growth rate of labor. In a graph of output per capita versus the capital-to-labor ratio, it is reflected by a move along the curve (i.e., the production function). An increase in total factor productivity causes a proportional upward shift in the entire production function. One method of measuring sustainable growth uses the production function and the growth accounting framework developed by Solow. It arrives at the growth rate of potential GDP by estimating the growth rates of the economys capital and labor inputs plus an estimate of total factor productivity. An alternative method measures potential growth as the long-term growth rate of the labor force plus the long-term growth rate of labor productivity. The forces driving economic growth include the quantity and quality of labor and the supply of non-ICT and ICT capital, public capital, raw materials, and technological knowledge. The labor supply is determined by population growth, the labor force participation rate, and net immigration. The physical capital stock in a country increases with net investment. The correlation between long-run economic growth and the rate of investment is high. Technological advances are discoveries that make it possible to produce more or higher-quality goods and services with the same resources or inputs. Technology is a major factor determining TFP. TFP is the main factor affecting long-term, sustainable economic growth rates in developed countries and also includes the cumulative effects of scientific advances, applied research and development, improvements in management methods, and ways of organizing production that raise the productive capacity of factories and offices. Total factor productivity, estimated using a growth accounting equation, is the residual component of growth after accounting for the weighted contributions of all explicit factors (e.g., labor and capital). Labor productivity is defined as output per worker or per hour worked. Growth in labor productivity depends on capital deepening and technological progress. The academic growth literature is divided into three theories —the classical view, the neoclassical model, and the new endogenous growth view. In the classical model, growth in per capita income is only temporary because an exploding population with limited resources brings per capita income growth to an end. In the neoclassical model, a sustained increase in investment increases the economys growth rate only in the short run. Capital is subject to diminishing marginal returns, so long-run growth depends solely on population growth, progress in TFP, and labors share of income. The neoclassical model assumes that the production function exhibits diminishing marginal productivity with respect to any individual input. The point at which capital per worker and output per worker are growing at equal, sustainable rates is called the steady state or balanced growth path for the economy. In the steady state, total output grows at the rate of labor force growth plus the rate of growth of TFP divided by the elasticity of output with respect to labor input. The following parameters affect the steady-state values for the capital-to-labor ratio and output per worker: saving rate, labor force growth, growth in TFP, depreciation rate, and elasticity of output with respect to capital. The main criticism of the neoclassical model is that it provides no quantifiable prediction of the rate or form of TFP change. TFP progress is regarded as exogenous to the model. Endogenous growth theory explains technological progress within the model rather than treating it as exogenous. As a result, self-sustaining growth emerges as a natural consequence of the model and the economy does not converge to a steady-state rate of growth that is independent of saving/investment decisions. Unlike the neoclassical model, where increasing capital will result in diminishing marginal returns, the endogenous growth model allows for the possibility of constant or even increasing returns to capital in the aggregate economy. In the endogenous growth model, expenditures made on R&amp;D and for human capital may have large positive externalities or spillover effects. Private spending by companies on knowledge capital generates benefits to the economy as a whole that exceed the private benefit to the company. The convergence hypothesis predicts that the rates of growth of productivity and GDP should be higher in the developing countries. Those higher growth rates imply that the per capita GDP gap between developing and developed economies should narrow over time. The evidence on convergence is mixed. Countries fail to converge because of low rates of investment and savings, lack of property rights, political instability, poor education and health, restrictions on trade, and tax and regulatory policies that discourage work and investing. Opening an economy to financial and trade flows has a major impact on economic growth. The evidence suggests that more open and trade-oriented economies will grow at a faster rate.",Economic Growth,2024
"The valuation of the equity of private companies is a major field of application for equity valuation. Private companies are those whose shares are not listed on public markets. Generalist investment practitioners need to be familiar with issues associated with valuations of such companies. We use the terms valuation and appraisal interchangeably in this chapter. Many public companies have start-up or other operations that can best be valued as if they were private companies. Companies may grow through the acquisition of competitors, including private companies, and analysts must be prepared to evaluate the price paid in such transactions. Furthermore, acquisitions often result in significant balances of intangible assets, including goodwill, that are reported on the balance sheets of acquiring companies. Goodwill balances require impairment assessment or formal testing on an annual basis under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US GAAP. Impairment testing and other financial reporting initiatives increasingly result in the use of fair value estimates in financial statements. The concepts and methods we will discuss play important roles in this aspect of financial reporting. In addition, issues relating to private company valuation arise in the types of investment held by venture capital and other types of private equity funds. The following sections illustrate key elements associated with the valuation of private companies and provide background for understanding private company valuation, including typical contrasts between public and private companies and the major purposes for which private valuations are performed. Later sections discuss earnings normalization and cash flow estimation; introduce the three major approaches recognized in private company valuation, valuation discounts, and premiums; and explain business valuation standards and practices.","The member should be able to: compare public and private company valuation; describe uses of private business valuation and explain applications of greatest concern to financial analysts; explain the income, market, and asset-based approaches to private company valuation and factors relevant to the selection of each approach; explain cash flow estimation issues related to private companies and adjustments required to estimate normalized earnings; calculate the value of a private company using free cash flow, capitalized cash flow, and/or excess earnings methods; explain factors that require adjustment when estimating the discount rate for private companies; compare models used to estimate the required rate of return to private company equity (for example, the CAPM, the expanded CAPM, and the build-up approach); calculate the value of a private company based on market approach methods and describe advantages and disadvantages of each method; describe the asset-based approach to private company valuation; explain and evaluate the effects on private company valuations of discounts and premiums based on control and marketability.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R4_private_company_valuation.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/private-company-valuation,"We have provided an overview of key elements of private company valuation and contrasted public and private company valuations. Company- and stock-specific factors may influence the selection of appropriate valuation methods and assumptions for private company valuations. Stock-specific factors may result in a lower value for an equity interest in a private company relative to a public company. Company-specific factors in which private companies differ from public companies include: stage in life cycle; size; overlap of shareholders and management; quality/depth of management; quality of financial and other information; pressure from short-term investors; and tax concerns. Stock-specific factors that frequently affect the value of private companies include liquidity of equity interests in business; concentration of control; and potential agreements restricting liquidity. Private company valuations are typically performed for three different reasons: transactions, compliance (financial or tax reporting), or litigation. Acquisition-related valuation issues and financial reporting valuation issues are of greatest importance in assessing public companies. Different definitions (standards) of value exist. The use of a valuation and key elements pertaining to the appraised company will help determine the appropriate definition. Key definitions of value include fair market value; market value; fair value for financial reporting; fair value in a litigation context; investment value; and intrinsic value. Private company valuations may require adjustments to the income statement to develop estimates of the companys normalized earnings. Adjustments may be required for non-recurring, non-economic, or other unusual items to eliminate anomalies and/or facilitate comparisons. Within the income approach, the FCF method is frequently used to value larger, mature private companies. For smaller companies or in special situations, the capitalized cash flow method and residual income method may also be used. Within the market approach, three methods are regularly used: the guideline public company method, guideline transactions method, and prior transactions method. An asset-based approach is infrequently used in valuing private companies. This approach may be appropriate for companies that are worth more in liquidation than as going concerns. This approach is also applied for asset holding companies, very small companies, or companies formed recently that have limited operating histories. Control and marketability issues are important and challenging elements in the valuation of private companies and equity interests therein. If publicly traded companies are used as the basis for pricing multiple(s), control premiums may be appropriate in measuring the total equity value of a private company. Control premiums have also been used to estimate lack of control discounts. Discounts for lack of control are used to convert a controlling interest value into a non-controlling equity interest value. Evidence of the adverse impact of the lack of control is an important consideration in assessing this discount. Discounts for lack of marketability are often used in valuing non-controlling equity interests in private companies. A DLOM may be inappropriate if the company has a high likelihood of a liquidity event in the immediate future. Quantification of DLOMs can be challenging because of limited data, differences in the interpretation of available data, and different interpretations of the lack of marketabilitys effect on a private company. DLOM can be estimated based on 1) private sales of restricted stock in public companies relative to their freely traded share price, 2) private sales of stock in companies prior to a subsequent IPO, and 3) the pricing of put options.",Private Company Valuation,2024
"Residual income models of equity value have become widely recognized tools in both investment practice and research. Conceptually, residual income is net income less a charge (deduction) for common shareholders opportunity cost in generating net income. It is the residual or remaining income after considering the costs of all of a companys capital. The appeal of residual income models stems from a shortcoming of traditional accounting. Specifically, although a companys income statement includes a charge for the cost of debt capital in the form of interest expense, it does not include a charge for the cost of equity capital. A company can have positive net income but may still not be adding value for shareholders if it does not earn more than its cost of equity capital. Residual income models explicitly recognize the costs of all the capital used in generating income. As an economic concept, residual income has a long history, dating back to Alfred Marshall in the late 1800s (Alfred Marshall, 1890). As far back as the 1920s, General Motors used the concept in evaluating business segments. More recently, residual income has received renewed attention and interest, sometimes under names such as economic profit, abnormal earnings, or economic value added. Although residual income concepts have been used in a variety of contexts, including the measurement of internal corporate performance, we will focus on the residual income model for estimating the intrinsic value of common stock. Among the questions we will study to help us apply residual income models are the following: How is residual income measured, and how can an analyst use residual income in valuation? How does residual income relate to fundamentals, such as return on equity and earnings growth rates? How is residual income linked to other valuation methods, such as a price-multiple approach? What accounting-based challenges arise in applying residual income valuation? The following section develops the concept of residual income, introduces the use of residual income in valuation, and briefly presents alternative measures used in practice. The subsequent sections present the residual income model and illustrate its use in valuing common stock, show practical applications, and describe the relative strengths and weaknesses of residual income valuation compared with other valuation methods. The last section addresses accounting issues in the use of residual income valuation. We then conclude with a summary.","The member should be able to: calculate and interpret residual income, economic value added, and market value added; describe the uses of residual income models; calculate the intrinsic value of a common stock using the residual income model and compare value recognition in residual income and other present value models; explain fundamental determinants of residual income; explain the relation between residual income valuation and the justified price-to-book ratio based on forecasted fundamentals; calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of a common stock using single-stage (constant-growth) and multistage residual income models; calculate the implied growth rate in residual income, given the market price-to-book ratio and an estimate of the required rate of return on equity; explain continuing residual income and justify an estimate of continuing residual income at the forecast horizon, given company and industry prospects; compare residual income models to dividend discount and free cash flow models; explain strengths and weaknesses of residual income models and justify the selection of a residual income model to value a companys common stock; describe accounting issues in applying residual income models; evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a residual income model.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R3_residual_income_valuation.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/residual-income-valuation,"We have discussed the use of residual income models in valuation. Residual income is an appealing economic concept because it attempts to measure economic profit, which are profits after accounting for all opportunity costs of capital. Residual income is calculated as net income minus a deduction for the cost of equity capital. The deduction, called the equity charge, is equal to equity capital multiplied by the required rate of return on equity (the cost of equity capital in percent). Economic value added (EVA) is a commercial implementation of the residual income concept. EVA = NOPAT − (C% × TC), where NOPAT is net operating profit after taxes, C% is the percent cost of capital, and TC is total capital. Residual income models (including commercial implementations) are used not only for equity valuation but also to measure internal corporate performance and for determining executive compensation. We can forecast per-share residual income as forecasted earnings per share minus the required rate of return on equity multiplied by beginning book value per share. Alternatively, per-share residual income can be forecasted as beginning book value per share multiplied by the difference between forecasted ROE and the required rate of return on equity. In the residual income model, the intrinsic value of a share of common stock is the sum of book value per share and the present value of expected future per-share residual income. In the residual income model, the equivalent mathematical expressions for intrinsic value of a common stock are V 0 = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 ∞ RI t ( 1 + r ) t = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 ∞ E t − r B t − 1 ( 1 + r ) t = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 ∞ ( ROE t − r ) B t − 1 ( 1 + r ) t where V 0 = value of a share of stock today (t = 0) B 0 = current per-share book value of equity Bt = expected per-share book value of equity at any time t r = required rate of return on equity (cost of equity) Et = expected earnings per share for period t RI t = expected per-share residual income, equal to Et − rBt –1 or to (ROE − r) × Bt –1 ROET = return on equity • In the two-stage model with continuing residual income in stage two, the intrinsic value of a share of stock is V 0 = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 T RI t ( 1 + r ) t + P T − B T ( 1 + r ) T = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 T ( E t − r B t − 1 ) ( 1 + r ) t + P T − B T ( 1 + r ) T V 0 = B 0 + ∑ t = 1 T ( ROE t − r ) B t − 1 ( 1 + r ) t + P T − B T ( 1 + r ) T where PT = expected per share price at terminal time T BT = expected per share book value at terminal time T",Residual Income Valuation,2024
"Interest rates are both a barometer of the economy and an instrument for its control. The term structure of interest rates—market interest rates at various maturities—is a vital input into the valuation of many financial products. The quantification of interest rate risk is of critical importance to risk managers. Understanding the determinants of interest rates, and thus the drivers of bond returns, is imperative for fixed-income market participants. Here, we explore the tools necessary to understand the term structure and interest rate dynamics—that is, the process by which bond yields and prices evolve over time. Section 1 explains how spot (or current) rates and forward rates, which are set today for a period starting in the future, are related, as well as how their relationship influences yield curve shape. Section 2 builds upon this foundation to show how forward rates impact the yield-to-maturity and expected bond returns. Section 3 explains how these concepts are put into practice by active fixed-income portfolio managers. The swap curve is the term structure of interest rates derived from a periodic exchange of payments based on fixed rates versus short-term market reference rates rather than default-risk-free government bonds. Sections 4 and 5 describe the swap curve and its relationship to government yields, known as the swap spread, and explains their use in valuation. Section 6 describes traditional theories of the term structure of interest rates. These theories outline several qualitative perspectives on economic forces that may affect the shape of the term structure. Section 7 describes yield curve factor models. The focus is a popular three-factor term structure model in which the yield curve changes are described in terms of three independent movements: level, steepness, and curvature. These factors can be extracted from the variance-covariance matrix of historical interest rate movements. Section 8 builds on the factor model and describes how to manage the risk of changing rates over different maturities. Section 9 concludes with a discussion of key variables known to influence interest rates, the development of interest rate views based on forecasts of those variables, and common trades tailored to capitalize on an interest rate view. A summary of key points concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: describe relationships among spot rates, forward rates, yield to maturity, expected and realized returns on bonds, and the shape of the yield curve; describe how zero-coupon rates (spot rates) may be obtained from the par curve by bootstrapping; describe the assumptions concerning the evolution of spot rates in relation to forward rates implicit in active bond portfolio management; describe the strategy of rolling down the yield curve; explain the swap rate curve and why and how market participants use it in valuation; calculate and interpret the swap spread for a given maturity; describe short-term interest rate spreads used to gauge economy-wide credit risk and liquidity risk; explain traditional theories of the term structure of interest rates and describe the implications of each theory for forward rates and the shape of the yield curve; explain how a bonds exposure to each of the factors driving the yield curve can be measured and how these exposures can be used to manage yield curve risks; explain the maturity structure of yield volatilities and their effect on price volatility; explain how key economic factors are used to establish a view on benchmark rates, spreads, and yield curve changes.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R5_term_structure_interest_rate_dynamics.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/term-structure-interest-rate-dynamics,"The spot rate for a given maturity can be expressed as a geometric average of the short-term rate and a series of forward rates. Forward rates are above (below) spot rates when the spot curve is upward (downward) sloping, whereas forward rates are equal to spot rates when the spot curve is flat. If forward rates are realized, then all bonds, regardless of maturity, will have the same one-period realized return, which is the first-period spot rate. If the spot rate curve is upward sloping and is unchanged, then each bond rolls down the curve and earns the forward rate that rolls out of its pricing (i.e., an N-period zero-coupon bond earns the N-period forward rate as it rolls down to be a N – 1 period security). This dynamic implies an expected return in excess of short-maturity bonds (i.e., a term premium) for longer-maturity bonds if the yield curve is upward sloping. Active bond portfolio management is consistent with the expectation that todays forward curve does not accurately reflect future spot rates. The swap curve provides another measure of the time value of money. Swaps are an essential tool frequently used by investors to hedge, take a position in, or otherwise modify interest rate risk. Bond quote conventions often use measures of spreads. Those quoted spreads can be used to determine a bonds price. Swap curves and Treasury curves can differ because of differences in their credit exposures, liquidity, and other supply/demand factors. Market participants often use interest rate spreads between short-term government and risky rates as a barometer to evaluate relative credit and liquidity risk. The local expectations theory, liquidity preference theory, segmented markets theory, and preferred habitat theory provide traditional explanations for the shape of the yield curve. Historical yield curve movements suggest that they can be explained by a linear combination of three principal movements: level, steepness, and curvature. The volatility term structure can be measured using historical data and depicts yield curve risk. The sensitivity of a bond value to yield curve changes may make use of effective duration, key rate durations, or sensitivities to parallel, steepness, and curvature movements. Using key rate durations or sensitivities to parallel, steepness, and curvature movements allows one to measure and manage shaping risk. The term bond risk premium refers to the expected excess return of a default-free long-term bond less that of an equivalent short-term bond or the one-period risk-free rate Several macroeconomic factors influence bond pricing and required returns such as inflation, economic growth, and monetary policy, among others. During highly uncertain market periods, investors flock to government bonds in a flight to quality that is often associated with bullish flattening, in which long-term rates fall by more than short-term rates. Investors expecting rates to fall will generally extend (shorten) portfolio duration to take advantage of expected bond price increases (decreases) When investors expect a steeper (flatter) curve under which long-term rates rise (fall) relative to short-term rates, they will sell (buy) long-term bonds and purchase (sell) short-term bonds.",The Term Structure and Interest Rate Dynamics,2024
"This reading covers two complex aspects of employee compensation: post-employment (retirement) benefits and share-based compensation. Retirement benefits include pensions and other post-employment benefits, such as health insurance. Examples of share-based compensation are stock options and stock grants. A common issue underlying both of these aspects of employee compensation is the difficulty in measuring the value of the compensation. One factor contributing to the difficulty is that employees earn the benefits in the periods that they provide service but typically receive the benefits in future periods, so measurement requires a significant number of assumptions. This reading provides an overview of the methods companies use to estimate and measure the benefits they provide to their employees and how this information is reported in financial statements. There has been some convergence between International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) in the measurement and accounting treatment for pensions, other post-employment benefits, and share-based compensation, but some differences remain. Although this reading focuses on IFRS as the basis for discussion, instances where US GAAP significantly differ are discussed. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 addresses pensions and other post-employment benefits, and Section 3 covers share-based compensation with a primary focus on the accounting for and analysis of stock options. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: describe the types of post-employment benefit plans and implications for financial reports; explain and calculate measures of a defined benefit pension obligation (i.e., present value of the defined benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation) and net pension liability (or asset); describe the components of a companys defined benefit pension costs; explain and calculate the effect of a defined benefit plans assumptions on the defined benefit obligation and periodic pension cost; explain and calculate how adjusting for items of pension and other post-employment benefits that are reported in the notes to the financial statements affects financial statements and ratios; interpret pension plan note disclosures including cash flow related information; explain issues associated with accounting for share-based compensation; explain how accounting for stock grants and stock options affects financial statements, and the importance of companies assumptions in valuing these grants and options.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V2R2_employee_compensation_post_employment_share_based.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/employee-compensation-post-employment-share-based,"This reading discussed two different forms of employee compensation: post-employment benefits and share-based compensation. Although different, the two are similar in that they are forms of compensation outside of the standard salary arrangements. They also involve complex valuation, accounting, and reporting issues. Although IFRS and US GAAP are converging on accounting and reporting, it is important to note that differences in a countrys social system, laws, and regulations can result in differences in a companys pension and share-based compensation plans that may be reflected in the companys earnings and financial reports. Key points include the following: Defined contribution pension plans specify (define) only the amount of contribution to the plan; the eventual amount of the pension benefit to the employee will depend on the value of an employees plan assets at the time of retirement. Balance sheet reporting is less analytically relevant for defined contribution plans because companies make contributions to defined contribution plans as the expense arises and thus no liabilities accrue for that type of plan. Defined benefit pension plans specify (define) the amount of the pension benefit, often determined by a plan formula, under which the eventual amount of the benefit to the employee is a function of length of service and final salary. Defined benefit pension plan obligations are funded by the sponsoring company contributing assets to a pension trust, a separate legal entity. Differences exist in countries regulatory requirements for companies to fund defined benefit pension plan obligations. Both IFRS and US GAAP require companies to report on their balance sheet a pension liability or asset equal to the projected benefit obligation minus the fair value of plan assets. The amount of a pension asset that can be reported is subject to a ceiling. Under IFRS, the components of periodic pension cost are recognised as follows: Service cost is recognised in P&amp;L, net interest income/expense is recognised in P&amp;L, and remeasurements are recognised in OCI and are not amortised to future P&amp;L. Under US GAAP, the components of periodic pension cost recognised in P&amp;L include current service costs, interest expense on the pension obligation, and expected returns on plan assets (which reduces the cost). Other components of periodic pension cost—including past service costs, actuarial gains and losses, and differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets—are recognised in OCI and amortised to future P&amp;L. Estimates of the future obligation under defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits are sensitive to numerous assumptions, including discount rates, assumed annual compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, and assumed health care cost inflation. Employee compensation packages are structured to fulfill varied objectives, including satisfying employees needs for liquidity, retaining employees, and providing incentives to employees. Common components of employee compensation packages are salary, bonuses, and share-based compensation. Share-based compensation serves to align employees interests with those of the shareholders. It includes stocks and stock options. Share-based compensation has the advantage of requiring no current-period cash outlays. Share-based compensation expense is reported at fair value under IFRS and US GAAP. The valuation technique, or option pricing model, that a company uses is an important choice in determining fair value and is disclosed. Key assumptions and input into option pricing models include such items as exercise price, stock price volatility, estimated life of each award, estimated number of options that will be forfeited, dividend yield, and the risk-free rate of interest. Certain assumptions are highly subjective, such as stock price volatility or the expected life of stock options, and can greatly change the estimated fair value and thus compensation expense.",Employee Compensation: Post-Employment and Share-Based,2024
"According to the World Trade Organization, merchandise exports worldwide were nearly US$15 trillion in 2010. The amount of worldwide merchandise exports in 2010 was more than twice the amount in 2003 (US$7.4 trillion) and more than four times the amount in 1993 (US$3.7 trillion). The top five exporting countries in 2010, in order, were China, the United States, Germany, Japan, and the Netherlands. In the United States alone, 293,131 companies were identified as exporters in 2010, but only 2.2% of those companies were large (more than 500 employees). The vast majority of US companies with export activity were small or medium-sized entities. The point illustrated by these statistics is that many companies engage in transactions that cross national borders. The parties to these transactions must agree on the currency in which to settle the transaction. Generally, this will be the currency of either the buyer or the seller. Exporters that receive payment in foreign currency and allow the purchaser time to pay must carry a foreign currency receivable on their books. Conversely, importers that agree to pay in foreign currency will have a foreign currency account payable. To be able to include them in the total amount of accounts receivable (payable) reported on the balance sheet, these foreign currency denominated accounts receivable (payable) must be translated into the currency in which the exporter (importer) keeps its books and presents financial statements. The prices at which foreign currencies can be purchased or sold are called foreign exchange rates. Because foreign exchange rates fluctuate over time, the value of foreign currency payables and receivables also fluctuates. The major accounting issue related to foreign currency transactions is how to reflect the changes in value for foreign currency payables and receivables in the financial statements. Many companies have operations located in foreign countries. For example, the Swiss food products company Nestlé SA reports that it has factories in 83 countries and a presence in almost every country in the world. US-based Procter &amp; Gambles annual filing discloses more than 400 subsidiaries located in more than 80 countries around the world. Foreign subsidiaries are generally required to keep accounting records in the currency of the country in which they are located. To prepare consolidated financial statements, the parent company must translate the foreign currency financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries into its own currency. Nestlé, for example, must translate the assets and liabilities its various foreign subsidiaries carry in foreign currency into Swiss francs to be able to consolidate those amounts with the Swiss franc assets and liabilities located in Switzerland. A multinational company like Nestlé is likely to have two types of foreign currency activities that require special accounting treatment. Most multinationals (1) engage in transactions that are denominated in a foreign currency and (2) invest in foreign subsidiaries that keep their books in a foreign currency. To prepare consolidated financial statements, a multinational company must translate the foreign currency amounts related to both types of international activities into the currency in which the company presents its financial statements. This reading presents the accounting for foreign currency transactions and the translation of foreign currency financial statements. The conceptual issues related to these accounting topics are discussed, and the specific rules embodied in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US GAAP are demonstrated through examples. Fortunately, differences between IFRS and US GAAP with respect to foreign currency translation issues are minimal. Analysts need to understand the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the financial statements of a multinational company and how a companys financial statements reflect foreign currency gains and losses, whether realized or not.","The member should be able to: distinguish among presentation (reporting) currency, functional currency, and local currency; describe foreign currency transaction exposure, including accounting for and disclosures about foreign currency transaction gains and losses; analyze how changes in exchange rates affect the translated sales of the subsidiary and parent company; compare the current rate method and the temporal method, evaluate how each affects the parent companys balance sheet and income statement, and determine which method is appropriate in various scenarios; calculate the translation effects and evaluate the translation of a subsidiarys balance sheet and income statement into the parent companys presentation currency; analyze how the current rate method and the temporal method affect financial statements and ratios; analyze how alternative translation methods for subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies affect financial statements and ratios; describe how multinational operations affect a companys effective tax rate; explain how changes in the components of sales affect the sustainability of sales growth; analyze how currency fluctuations potentially affect financial results, given a companys countries of operation.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V2R3_multinational_operations.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/multinational-operations,"The translation of foreign currency amounts is an important accounting issue for companieswith multinational operations. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations cause the functionalcurrency values of foreign currency assets and liabilities resulting from foreigncurrency transactions as well as from foreign subsidiaries to change over time. Thesechanges in value give rise to foreign exchange differences that companies financialstatements must reflect. Determining how to measure these foreign exchange differencesand whether to include them in the calculation of net income are the major issuesin accounting for multinational operations. The local currency is the national currency of the country where an entity is located. The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. Normally, the local currency is an entitys functional currency. For accounting purposes, any currency other than an entitys functional currency is a foreign currency for that entity. The currency in which financial statement amounts are presented is known as the presentation currency. In most cases, the presentation currency will be the same as the local currency. When an export sale (import purchase) on an account is denominated in a foreign currency, the sales revenue (inventory) and foreign currency account receivable (account payable) are translated into the sellers (buyers) functional currency using the exchange rate on the transaction date. Any change in the functional currency value of the foreign currency account receivable (account payable) that occurs between the transaction date and the settlement date is recognized as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss in net income. If a balance sheet date falls between the transaction date and the settlement date, the foreign currency account receivable (account payable) is translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. The change in the functional currency value of the foreign currency account receivable (account payable) is recognized as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss in income. Analysts should understand that these gains and losses are unrealized at the time they are recognized and might or might not be realized when the transactions are settled. A foreign currency transaction gain arises when an entity has a foreign currency receivable and the foreign currency strengthens or it has a foreign currency payable and the foreign currency weakens. A foreign currency transaction loss arises when an entity has a foreign currency receivable and the foreign currency weakens or it has a foreign currency payable and the foreign currency strengthens. Companies must disclose the net foreign currency gain or loss included in income. They may choose to report foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a component of operating income or as a component of non-operating income. If two companies choose to report foreign currency transaction gains and losses differently, operating profit and operating profit margin might not be directly comparable between the two companies. To prepare consolidated financial statements, foreign currency financial statements of foreign operations must be translated into the parent companys presentation currency. The major conceptual issues related to this translation process are, What is the appropriate exchange rate for translating each financial statement item, and how should the resulting translation adjustment be reflected in the consolidated financial statements? Two different translation methods are used worldwide. Under the current rate method, assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate, equity items are translated at historical exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate that existed when the underlying transaction occurred. For practical reasons, an average exchange rate is often used to translate income items. Under the temporal method, monetary assets (and non-monetary assets measured at current value) and monetary liabilities (and non-monetary liabilities measured at current value) are translated at the current exchange rate. Non-monetary assets and liabilities not measured at current value and equity items are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses, other than those expenses related to non-monetary assets, are translated at the exchange rate that existed when the underlying transaction occurred. Expenses related to non-monetary assets are translated at the exchange rates used for the related assets. Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the functional currency of a foreign operation determines the method to be used in translating its foreign currency financial statements into the parents presentation currency and whether the resulting translation adjustment is recognized in income or as a separate component of equity. The foreign currency financial statements of a foreign operation that has a foreign currency as its functional currency are translated using the current rate method, and the translation adjustment is accumulated as a separate component of equity. The cumulative translation adjustment related to a specific foreign entity is transferred to net income when that entity is sold or otherwise disposed of. The balance sheet risk exposure associated with the current rate method is equal to the foreign subsidiarys net asset position. The foreign currency financial statements of a foreign operation that has the parents presentation currency as its functional currency are translated using the temporal method, and the translation adjustment is included as a gain or loss in income. US GAAP refer to this process as remeasurement. The balance sheet exposure associated with the temporal method is equal to the foreign subsidiarys net monetary asset/liability position (adjusted for non-monetary items measured at current value). IFRS and US GAAP differ with respect to the translation of foreign currency financial statements of foreign operations located in a highly inflationary country. Under IFRS, the foreign currency statements are first restated for local inflation and then translated using the current exchange rate. Under US GAAP, the foreign currency financial statements are translated using the temporal method, with no restatement for inflation. Applying different translation methods for a given foreign operation can result in very different amounts reported in the parents consolidated financial statements. Companies must disclose the total amount of translation gain or loss reported in income and the amount of translation adjustment included in a separate component of stockholders equity. Companies are not required to separately disclose the component of translation gain or loss arising from foreign currency transactions and the component arising from application of the temporal method. Disclosures related to translation adjustments reported in equity can be used to include these as gains and losses in determining an adjusted amount of income following a clean-surplus approach to income measurement. Foreign currency translation rules are well established in both IFRS and US GAAP. Fortunately, except for the treatment of foreign operations located in highly inflationary countries, the two sets of standards have no major differences in this area. The ability to understand the impact of foreign currency translation on the financial results of a company using IFRS should apply equally well in the analysis of financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP. An analyst can obtain information about the tax impact of multinational operations from companies disclosure on effective tax rates. For a multinational company, sales growth is driven not only by changes in volume and price but also by changes in the exchange rates between the reporting currency and the currency in which sales are made. Arguably, growth in sales that comes from changes in volume or price is more sustainable than growth in sales that comes from changes in exchange rates.",Multinational Operations,2024
"The ability to assess the quality of reported financial information can be a valuable skill. An analyst or investor who can recognize high-quality financial reporting can have greater confidence in analysis based on those financial reports and the resulting investment decisions. Similarly, an analyst or investor who can recognize poor financial reporting quality early—before deficiencies become widely known—is more likely to make profitable investment decisions or to reduce or even avoid losses. An example of early recognition of an ultimate financial disaster is James Chanoss short position in Enron in November 2000 —more than a year before Enron filed for bankruptcy protection (in December 2001). Despite Enrons high profile and reputation, Chanos had a negative view of Enron based on both quantitative and qualitative factors. Chanos noted that Enrons return on capital was both lower than comparable companies return on capital and lower than the companys own cost of capital. Qualitative factors contributing to Chanoss view included the companys aggressive revenue recognition policy, its complex and difficult-to-understand disclosures on related-party transactions, and one-time earnings-boosting gains. Later events that substantiated Chanoss perspective included sales of the companys stock by insiders and the resignation of senior executives. Another example of early recognition of eventual financial troubles is June 2001 reports by analyst Enitan Adebonojo. These reports highlighted questionable accounting by Royal Ahold, a European food retailer. The questionable accounting included claiming profits of acquired firms as organic growth, booking capital gains from sale-and-leaseback deals as profit, and keeping billions in debt off its balance sheet. In 2003, Royal Ahold announced that it had significantly overstated its profits in the prior two years. The CEO and CFO resigned, various regulators announced investigations, and Royal Aholds market value dropped significantly. This reading focuses on reporting quality and the interrelated attribute of results quality. Reporting quality pertains to the information disclosed in financial reports. High-quality reporting provides decision-useful information—information that is relevant and faithfully represents the economic reality of the companys activities during the reporting period and the companys financial condition at the end of the period. A separate, but interrelated, attribute of quality is results or earnings quality, which pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the companys actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition relative to expectations of current and future financial performance. Note that the term earnings quality is more commonly used in practice than results quality, so throughout this reading, earnings quality is used broadly to encompass the quality of earnings, cash flow, and/or balance sheet items. High-quality earnings reflect an adequate level of return on investment and are derived from activities that a company will likely be able to sustain in the future. Thus, high-quality earnings increase the value of a company more than low-quality earnings. When reported earnings are described as being high quality, it means that the companys underlying economic performance was good (i.e., value enhancing), and it also implies that the company had high reporting quality (i.e., that the information that the company calculated and disclosed was a good reflection of the economic reality). Earnings can be termed low quality either because the reported information properly represents genuinely bad performance or because the reported information misrepresents economic reality. In theory, a company could have low-quality earnings while simultaneously having high reporting quality. Consider a company with low-quality earnings—for example, one whose only source of earnings in a period is a one-off settlement of a lawsuit without which the company would have reported huge losses. The company could nonetheless have high reporting quality if it calculated its results properly and provided decision-useful information. Although it is theoretically possible that a company could have low-quality earnings while simultaneously having high reporting quality, experiencing poor financial performance can motivate the companys management to misreport. This reading begins in Section 2 with a description of a conceptual framework for and potential problems with financial reporting quality. This is followed in Section 3 with a discussion of how to evaluate financial reporting quality. Sections 4, 5, and 6 focus on the quality of reported earnings, cash flows, and balance sheets, respectively. Section 7 covers sources of information about risk. A summary and practice problems in the CFA Institute item set format complete the reading.",The member should be able to: demonstrate the use of a conceptual framework for assessing the quality of a companys financial reports; explain potential problems that affect the quality of financial reports; describe how to evaluate the quality of a companys financial reports; evaluate the quality of a companys financial reports; describe the concept of sustainable (persistent) earnings; describe indicators of earnings quality; explain mean reversion in earnings and how the accruals component of earnings affects the speed of mean reversion; evaluate the earnings quality of a company; describe indicators of cash flow quality; evaluate the cash flow quality of a company; describe indicators of balance sheet quality; evaluate the balance sheet quality of a company; describe sources of information about risk.,Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V2R5_evaluatingquality_financial_reports.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/evaluating-quality-financial-reports,,Evaluating Quality of Financial Reports,2024
"Discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation views the intrinsic value of a security as the present value of its expected future cash flows. When applied to dividends, the DCF model is the discounted dividend approach or dividend discount model (DDM). Our coverage extends DCF analysis to value a company and its equity securities by valuing free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE). Whereas dividends are the cash flows actually paid to stockholders, free cash flows are the cash flows available for distribution to shareholders. Unlike dividends, FCFF and FCFE are not readily available data. Analysts need to compute these quantities from available financial information, which requires a clear understanding of free cash flows and the ability to interpret and use the information correctly. Forecasting future free cash flows is a rich and demanding exercise. The analysts understanding of a companys financial statements, its operations, its financing, and its industry can pay real dividends as he or she addresses that task. Many analysts consider free cash flow models to be more useful than DDMs in practice. Free cash flows provide an economically sound basis for valuation. A study of professional analysts substantiates the importance of free cash flow valuation (Pinto, Robinson, Stowe 2019). When valuing individual equities, 92.8% of analysts use market multiples and 78.8% use a discounted cash flow approach. When using discounted cash flow analysis, 20.5% of analysts use a residual income approach, 35.1% use a dividend discount model, and 86.9% use a discounted free cash flow model. Of those using discounted free cash flow models, FCFF models are used roughly twice as frequently as FCFE models. Analysts often use more than one method to value equities, and it is clear that free cash flow analysis is in near universal use. Analysts like to use free cash flow as the return (either FCFF or FCFE) whenever one or more of the following conditions is present: The company does not pay dividends. The company pays dividends, but the dividends paid differ significantly from the companys capacity to pay dividends. Free cash flows align with profitability within a reasonable forecast period with which the analyst is comfortable. The investor takes a control perspective. With control comes discretion over the uses of free cash flow. If an investor can take control of the company (or expects another investor to do so), dividends may be changed substantially; for example, they may be set at a level approximating the companys capacity to pay dividends. Such an investor can also apply free cash flows to uses such as servicing the debt incurred in an acquisition. Common equity can be valued directly by finding the present value of FCFE or indirectly by first using an FCFF model to estimate the value of the firm and then subtracting the value of non-common-stock capital (usually debt) to arrive at an estimate of the value of equity. The purpose of the coverage in the subsequent sections is to develop the background required to use the FCFF or FCFE approaches to value a companys equity. In the next section, we define the concepts of free cash flow to the firm and free cash flow to equity and then present the two valuation models based on discounting of FCFF and FCFE. We also explore the constant-growth models for valuing FCFF and FCFE, which are special cases of the general models. The subsequent sections turn to the vital task of calculating and forecasting FCFF and FCFE. They also explain multistage free cash flow valuation models and present some of the issues associated with their application. Analysts usually value operating assets and non-operating assets separately and then combine them to find the total value of the firm, an approach described in the last section on this topic.","The member should be able to: compare the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) approaches to valuation; explain the ownership perspective implicit in the FCFE approach; explain the appropriate adjustments to net income, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and cash flow from operations (CFO) to calculate FCFF and FCFE; calculate FCFF and FCFE; describe approaches for forecasting FCFF and FCFE; compare the FCFE model and dividend discount models; explain how dividends, share repurchases, share issues, and changes in leverage may affect future FCFF and FCFE; evaluate the use of net income and EBITDA as proxies for cash flow in valuation; explain the single-stage (stable-growth), two-stage, and three-stage FCFF and FCFE models and select and justify the appropriate model given a companys characteristics; estimate a companys value using the appropriate free cash flow model(s); explain the use of sensitivity analysis in FCFF and FCFE valuations; describe approaches for calculating the terminal value in a multistage valuation model; and evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued based on a free cash flow valuation model.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V4R1_free_cash_flow_valuation.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/free-cash-flow-valuation,"Discounted cash flow models are widely used by analysts to value companies. Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE) are the cash flows available to, respectively, all of the investors in the company and to common stockholders. Analysts like to use free cash flow (either FCFF or FCFE) as the return if the company is not paying dividends; if the company pays dividends but the dividends paid differ significantly from the companys capacity to pay dividends; if free cash flows align with profitability within a reasonable forecast period with which the analyst is comfortable; or if the investor takes a control perspective. The FCFF valuation approach estimates the value of the firm as the present value of future FCFF discounted at the weighted average cost of capital: Firm value = ∑ t = 1 ∞ FCFF t ( 1 + WACC ) t . The value of equity is the value of the firm minus the value of the firms debt: Equity value = Firm value – Market value of debt. Dividing the total value of equity by the number of outstanding shares gives the value per share. The WACC formula is WACC = MV ( Debt ) MV ( Debt ) + MV ( Equity ) r d ( 1 − Tax rate ) + MV(Equity) MV ( Debt ) + MV ( Equity ) r . The value of the firm if FCFF is growing at a constant rate is Firm value = FCFF 1 WACC − g = FCFF 0 ( 1 + g ) WACC − g . With the FCFE valuation approach, the value of equity can be found by discounting FCFE at the required rate of return on equity, r: Equity value = ∑ t = 1 ∞ FCFE t ( 1 + r ) t . Dividing the total value of equity by the number of outstanding shares gives the value per share. The value of equity if FCFE is growing at a constant rate is Equity value = FCFE 1 r − g = FCFE 0 ( 1 + g ) r − g . FCFF and FCFE are frequently calculated by starting with net income: FCFF = NI + NCC + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv. FCFE = NI + NCC – FCInv – WCInv + Net borrowing. FCFF and FCFE are related to each other as follows: FCFE = FCFF – Int(1 – Tax rate) + Net borrowing. FCFF and FCFE can be calculated by starting from cash flow from operations: FCFF = CFO + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv. FCFE = CFO – FCInv + Net borrowing. FCFF can also be calculated from EBIT or EBITDA: FCFF = EBIT(1 – Tax rate) + Dep – FCInv – WCInv. FCFF = EBITDA(1 – Tax rate) + Dep(Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv. FCFE can then be found by using FCFE = FCFF – Int(1 – Tax rate) + Net borrowing. Finding CFO, FCFF, and FCFE may require careful interpretation of corporate financial statements. In some cases, the necessary information may not be transparent. Earnings components such as net income, EBIT, EBITDA, and CFO should not be used as cash flow measures to value a firm. These earnings components either double-count or ignore parts of the cash flow stream. FCFF or FCFE valuation expressions can be easily adapted to accommodate complicated capital structures, such as those that include preferred stock. A general expression for the two-stage FCFF valuation model is Firm value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFF t ( 1 + WACC ) t + FCFF n + 1 ( WACC − g ) 1 ( 1 + WACC ) n . A general expression for the two-stage FCFE valuation model is Equity value = ∑ t = 1 n FCFE t ( 1 + r ) t + ( FCFE n + 1 r − g ) [ 1 ( 1 + r ) n ] . One common two-stage model assumes a constant growth rate in each stage, and a second common model assumes declining growth in Stage 1 followed by a long-run sustainable growth rate in Stage 2. To forecast FCFF and FCFE, analysts build a variety of models of varying complexity. A common approach is to forecast sales, with profitability, investments, and financing derived from changes in sales. Three-stage models are often considered to be good approximations for cash flow streams that, in reality, fluctuate from year to year. Non-operating assets, such as excess cash and marketable securities, noncurrent investment securities, and nonperforming assets, are usually segregated from the companys operating assets. They are valued separately and then added to the value of the companys operating assets to find total firm value.",Free Cash Flow Valuation,2024
"It is important to keep in mind that financial analysis is a means to an end and not the end itself. Rather than try to apply every possible technique and tool to every situation, it is essential for the investor to consider and identify the proper type of analysis to apply in a given situation. The primary reason for performing financial analysis is to help in making an economic decision. Before making such decisions as whether to lend to a particular long-term borrower or to invest a large sum in a common stock, venture capital vehicle, or private equity candidate, an investor or financial decision-maker wants to make sure that the probability of a successful outcome is on his or her side. Rather than leave outcomes to chance, a financial decision-maker should use financial analysis to identify and make more visible potential favorable and unfavorable outcomes. The purpose of this reading is to provide examples of the effective use of financial analysis in decision making. The framework for the analysis is shown in .

"Every day, thousands of participants in the investment profession—investors, portfolio managers, regulators, researchers—face a common and often perplexing question: What is the value of a particular asset? The answers to this question usually influence success or failure in achieving investment objectives. For one group of those participants—equity analysts—the question and its potential answers are particularly critical because determining the value of an ownership stake is at the heart of their professional activities and decisions. Valuation is the estimation of an assets value based on variables perceived to be related to future investment returns, on comparisons with similar assets, or, when relevant, on estimates of immediate liquidation proceeds. Skill in valuation is a very important element of success in investing. We address some basic questions: What is value? Who uses equity valuations? What is the importance of industry knowledge? How can the analyst effectively communicate his analysis? We answer these and other questions and lay a foundation for the topics that follow. The following section defines value and describes the various uses of equity valuation.

Valuation is the estimation of an assets value based on either variables perceived to be related to future investment returns or comparisons with closely similar assets. The intrinsic value of an asset is its value given a hypothetically complete understanding of the assets investment characteristics. The assumption that the market price of a security can diverge from its intrinsic value—as suggested by the rational efficient markets formulation of efficient market theory—underpins active investing. Intrinsic value incorporates the going-concern assumption, that is, the assumption that a company will continue operating for the foreseeable future. In contrast, liquidation value is the companys value if it were dissolved and its assets sold individually. Fair value is the price at which an asset (or liability) would change hands if neither buyer nor seller were under compulsion to buy/sell and both were informed about material underlying facts. In addition to stock selection by active traders, valuation is also used for: inferring (extracting) market expectations; evaluating corporate events; issuing fairness opinions; evaluating business strategies and models; and appraising private businesses. The valuation process has five steps: Understanding the business. Forecasting company performance. Selecting the appropriate valuation model. Converting forecasts to a valuation. Applying the analytical results in the form of recommendations and conclusions. Understanding the business includes evaluating industry prospects, competitive position, and corporate strategies—all of which contribute to making more accurate forecasts. Understanding the business also involves analysis of financial reports, including evaluating the quality of a companys earnings. In forecasting company performance, a top-down forecasting approach moves from macroeconomic forecasts to industry forecasts and then to individual company and asset forecasts. A bottom-up forecasting approach aggregates individual company forecasts to industry forecasts, which in turn may be aggregated to macroeconomic forecasts. Selecting the appropriate valuation approach means choosing an approach that is: consistent with the characteristics of the company being valued; appropriate given the availability and quality of the data; and consistent with the analysts valuation purpose and perspective. Two broad categories of valuation models are absolute valuation models and relative valuation models. Absolute valuation models specify an assets intrinsic value, supplying a point estimate of value that can be compared with market price. Present value models of common stock (also called discounted cash flow models) are the most important type of absolute valuation model. Relative valuation models specify an assets value relative to the value of another asset. As applied to equity valuation, relative valuation is also known as the method of comparables, which involves comparison of a stocks price multiple to a benchmark price multiple. The benchmark price multiple can be based on a similar stock or on the average price multiple of some group of stocks. Two important aspects of converting forecasts to valuation are sensitivity analysis and situational adjustments. Sensitivity analysis is an analysis to determine how changes in an assumed input would affect the outcome of an analysis. Situational adjustments include control premiums (premiums for a controlling interest in the company), discounts for lack of marketability (discounts reflecting the lack of a public market for the companys shares), and illiquidity discounts (discounts reflecting the lack of a liquid market for the companys shares). Applying valuation conclusions depends on the purpose of the valuation. In performing valuations, analysts must hold themselves accountable to both standards of competence and standards of conduct. An effective research report: contains timely information; is written in clear, incisive language; is objective and well researched, with key assumptions clearly identified; distinguishes clearly between facts and opinions; contains analysis, forecasts, valuation, and a recommendation that are internally consistent; presents sufficient information that the reader can critique the valuation; states the risk factors for an investment in the company; and discloses any potential conflicts of interest faced by the analyst. Analysts have an obligation to provide substantive and meaningful content. CFA Institute members have an additional overriding responsibility to adhere to the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and relevant specific Standards of Professional Conduct.",Equity Valuation: Applications and Processes,2023
"Intercorporate investments (investments in other companies) can have a significant impact on an investing companys financial performance and position. Companies invest in the debt and equity securities of other companies to diversify their asset base, enter new markets, obtain competitive advantages, deploy excess cash, and achieve additional profitability. Debt securities include commercial paper, corporate and government bonds and notes, redeemable preferred stock, and asset-backed securities. Equity securities include common stock and non-redeemable preferred stock. The percentage of equity ownership a company acquires in an investee depends on the resources available, the ability to acquire the shares, and the desired level of influence or control. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) worked to reduce differences in accounting standards that apply to the classification, measurement, and disclosure of intercorporate investments. The resulting standards have improved the relevance, transparency, and comparability of information provided in financial statements. Complete convergence between IFRS accounting standards and US GAAP did not occur for accounting for financial instruments, and some differences still exist. The terminology used in this reading is IFRS-oriented. US GAAP may not use identical terminology, but in most cases the terminology is similar. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the basic categorization of corporate investments. Section 3 describes reporting under IFRS 9, the IASB standard for financial instruments. Section 4 describes equity method reporting for investments in associates where significant influence can exist including the reporting for joint ventures, a type of investment where control is shared. Section 5 describes reporting for business combinations, the parent/subsidiary relationship, and variable interest and special purpose entities.

Investments in other companies can take five basic forms: investments in financial assets, investments in associates, joint ventures, business combinations, and investments in special purpose and variable interest entities. Key concepts are as follows: Investments in financial assets are those in which the investor has no significant influence. They can be measured and reported as Fair value through profit or loss. Fair value through other comprehensive income. Amortized cost. IFRS and US GAAP treat investments in financial assets in a similar manner. Investments in associates and joint ventures are those in which the investor has significant influence, but not control, over the investees business activities. Because the investor can exert significant influence over financial and operating policy decisions, IFRS and US GAAP require the equity method of accounting because it provides a more objective basis for reporting investment income. The equity method requires the investor to recognize income as earned rather than when dividends are received. The equity investment is carried at cost, plus its share of post-acquisition income (after adjustments) less dividends received. The equity investment is reported as a single line item on the balance sheet and on the income statement. IFRS and US GAAP accounting standards require the use of the acquisition method to account for business combinations. Fair value of the consideration given is the appropriate measurement for identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination. Goodwill is the difference between the acquisition value and the fair value of the targets identifiable net tangible and intangible assets. Because it is considered to have an indefinite life, it is not amortized. Instead, it is evaluated at least annually for impairment. Impairment losses are reported on the income statement. IFRS use a one-step approach to determine and measure the impairment loss, whereas US GAAP uses a two-step approach. If the acquiring company acquires less than 100%, non-controlling (minority) shareholders interests are reported on the consolidated financial statements. IFRS allows the non-controlling interest to be measured at either its fair value (full goodwill) or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets (partial goodwill). US GAAP requires the non-controlling interest to be measured at fair value (full goodwill). Consolidated financial statements are prepared in each reporting period. Special purpose (SPEs) and variable interest entities (VIEs) are required to be consolidated by the entity which is expected to absorb the majority of the expected losses or receive the majority of expected residual benefits.",Intercorporate Investments,2024
" A non-current liability (long-term liability) broadly represents a probable sacrifice of economic benefits in periods generally greater than one year in the future. Common types of non-current liabilities reported in a companys financial statements include long-term debt (e.g., bonds payable, long-term notes payable), leases, pension liabilities, and deferred tax liabilities. This reading focuses on bonds payable, leases, and pension liabilities. This reading is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces bonds and the accounting for their issuance. Section 3 discusses the recording of interest expense and interest payments as well as the amortisation of discount or premium. Section 4 describes fair value accounting for bonds, an alternative to the amortised cost approach. Section 5 discusses the repayment of principal when bonds are redeemed or reach maturity, which requires derecognition from the financial statements. Section 6 covers debt covenants. Section 7 describes the financial statement presentation and disclosures about debt financings. Section 8 discusses leases, including the benefits of leasing and accounting for leases by both lessees and lessors. Section 9 introduces pension accounting and the resulting non-current liabilities. Section 10 discusses the use of leverage and coverage ratios in evaluating solvency. Section 11 concludes and summarises the reading.

Bonds are a common source of financing from debt markets. Key points in accounting and reporting of non-current liabilities include the following: The sales proceeds of a bond issue are determined by discounting future cash payments using the market rate of interest at the time of issuance (effective interest rate). The reported interest expense on bonds is based on the effective interest rate. Future cash payments on bonds usually include periodic interest payments (made at the stated interest rate or coupon rate) and the principal amount at maturity. When the market rate of interest equals the coupon rate for the bonds, the bonds will sell at par (i.e., at a price equal to the face value). When the market rate of interest is higher than the bonds coupon rate, the bonds will sell at a discount. When the market rate of interest is lower than the bonds coupon rate, the bonds will sell at a premium. An issuer amortises any issuance discount or premium on bonds over the life of the bonds. If a company redeems bonds before maturity, it reports a gain or loss on debt extinguishment computed as the net carrying amount of the bonds (including bond issuance costs under IFRS) less the amount required to redeem the bonds. Debt covenants impose restrictions on borrowers, such as limitations on future borrowing or requirements to maintain a minimum debt-to-equity ratio. The carrying amount of bonds is typically the amortised historical cost, which can differ from their fair value. Companies are required to disclose the fair value of financial liabilities, including debt. Although permitted to do so, few companies opt to report debt at fair values on the balance sheet. A lease is a contract in which a lessor grants the lessee the exclusive right to use a specific underlying asset for a period of time in exchange for payments. Leasing is a common arrangement because it has several advantages over purchasing an asset outright: less upfront cash commitment, generally low interest rates, and lower risks associated with ownership such as obsolescence. Leases are classified as operating or finance leases. Finance leases resemble an asset purchase or sale while operating leases resemble a rental agreement. US GAAP and IFRS share the same accounting treatment for lessors but differ for lessees. IFRS has a single accounting model for both operating leases and finance lease lessees, while US GAAP has an accounting model for each. Lessees reporting under IFRS and finance lease lessees reporting under US GAAP recognize a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet, equal to the present value of lease payments. The liability is subsequently reduced using the effective interest method and the right-of-use asset is amortized. Interest expense and amortization expense are shown separately on the income statement. The statement of cash flows shows the entire lease payment. Operating lease lessees reporting under US GAAP recognize a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet, equal to the present value of lease payments. The liability is subsequently reduced using the effective interest method, but the amortization of the right-of-use asset is the lease payment less the interest expense. Interest expense and amortization expense are shown together as a single operating expense on the income statement. Finance lease lessors (IFRS and US GAAP) recognize a lease receivable asset equal to the present value of future lease payments and de-recognize the leased asset, simultaneously recognizing any difference as a gain or loss. The lease receivable is subsequently reduced by each lease payment using the effective interest method. Interest income is reported on the income statement, typically as revenue, and the entire cash receipt is reported under operating activities on the statement of cash flows. Operating lease lessors (IFRS and US GAAP): The balance sheet is not affected—The lessor continues to recognize the underlying asset and depreciate it. Lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis on the income statement and the entire cash receipt is reported under operating activities on the statement of cash flows. Two types of pension plans are defined contribution plans and defined benefits plans. In a defined contribution plan, the amount of contribution into the plan is specified (i.e., defined) and the amount of pension that is ultimately paid by the plan (received by the retiree) depends on the performance of the plans assets. In a defined benefit plan, the amount of pension that is ultimately paid by the plan (received by the retiree) is defined, usually according to a benefit formula. Under a defined contribution pension plan, the cash payment made into the plan is recognised as pension expense. Under both IFRS and US GAAP, companies must report the difference between the defined benefit pension obligation and the pension assets as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. An underfunded defined benefit pension plan is shown as a non-current liability. Under IFRS, the change in the defined benefit plan net asset or liability is recognised as a cost of the period, with two components of the change (service cost and net interest expense or income) recognised in profit and loss and one component (remeasurements) of the change recognised in other comprehensive income. Under US GAAP, the change in the defined benefit plan net asset or liability is also recognised as a cost of the period with three components of the change (current service costs, interest expense on the beginning pension obligation, and expected return on plan assets) recognised in profit and loss and two components (past service costs and actuarial gains and losses) typically recognised in other comprehensive income. Solvency refers to a companys ability to meet its long-term debt obligations. In evaluating solvency, leverage ratios focus on the balance sheet and measure the amount of debt financing relative to equity financing. In evaluating solvency, coverage ratios focus on the income statement and cash flows and measure the ability of a company to cover its interest payments.",Non-Current (Long-Term) Liabilities,2023
"With bonds outstanding worth many trillions of US dollars, the debt markets play a critical role in the global economy. Companies and governments raise capital in the debt market to fund current operations; buy equipment; build factories, roads, bridges, airports, and hospitals; acquire assets; and so on. By channeling savings into productive investments, the debt markets facilitate economic growth. Credit analysis has a crucial function in the debt capital markets—efficiently allocating capital by properly assessing credit risk, pricing it accordingly, and repricing it as risks change. How do fixed-income investors determine the riskiness of that debt, and how do they decide what they need to earn as compensation for that risk? In the sections that follow, we cover basic principles of credit analysis, which may be broadly defined as the process by which credit risk is evaluated. Readers will be introduced to the definition of credit risk, the interpretation of credit ratings, the four Cs of traditional credit analysis, and key financial measures and ratios used in credit analysis. We explain, among other things, how to compare bond issuer creditworthiness within a given industry as well as across industries and how credit risk is priced in the bond market. Our coverage focuses primarily on analysis of corporate debt; however, credit analysis of sovereign and nonsovereign, particularly municipal, government bonds will also be addressed. Structured finance, a segment of the debt markets that includes securities backed by such pools of assets as residential and commercial mortgages as well as other consumer loans, will not be covered here. We first introduce the key components of credit risk—default probability and loss severity— along with such credit-related risks as spread risk, credit migration risk, and liquidity risk. We then discuss the relationship between credit risk and the capital structure of the firm before turning attention to the role of credit rating agencies. We also explore the process of analyzing the credit risk of corporations and examine the impact of credit spreads on risk and return. Finally, we look at special considerations applicable to the analysis of (i) high-yield (low-quality) corporate bonds and (ii) government bonds.","The member should be able to: describe credit risk and credit-related risks affecting corporate bonds;&lt;list-type&gt;los&lt;/list-type&gt; describe default probability and loss severity as components of credit risk; describe seniority rankings of corporate debt and explain the potential violation of the priority of claims in a bankruptcy proceeding; compare and contrast corporate issuer credit ratings and issue credit ratings and describe the rating agency practice of notching; explain risks in relying on ratings from credit rating agencies; explain the four Cs (Capacity, Collateral, Covenants, and Character) of traditional credit analysis; calculate and interpret financial ratios used in credit analysis; evaluate the credit quality of a corporate bond issuer and a bond of that issuer, given key financial ratios of the issuer and the industry; describe macroeconomic, market, and issuer-specific factors that influence the level and volatility of yield spreads; explain special considerations when evaluating the credit of high-yield, sovereign, and non-sovereign government debt issuers and issues.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V5R2-fundamentals-credit-analysis.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/fundamentals-credit-analysis,"In this reading, we introduced readers to the basic principles of credit analysis. We described the importance of the credit markets and credit and credit-related risks. We discussed the role and importance of credit ratings and the methodology associated with assigning ratings, as well as the risks of relying on credit ratings. The reading covered the key components of credit analysis and the financial measure used to help assess creditworthiness. We also discussed risk versus return when investing in credit and how spread changes affect holding period returns. In addition, we addressed the special considerations to take into account when doing credit analysis of high-yield companies, sovereign borrowers, and non-sovereign government bonds. Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the borrower failing to make full and timely payments of interest and/or principal. The key components of credit risk are risk of default and loss severity in the event of default. The product of the two is expected loss. Investors in higher-quality bonds tend not to focus on loss severity because default risk for those securities is low. Loss severity equals (1 – Recovery rate). Credit-related risks include downgrade risk (also called credit migration risk) and market liquidity risk. Either of these can cause yield spreads—yield premiums—to rise and bond prices to fall. Downgrade risk refers to a decline in an issuers creditworthiness. Downgrades will cause its bonds to trade with wider yield spreads and thus lower prices. Market liquidity risk refers to a widening of the bid–ask spread on an issuers bonds. Lower-quality bonds tend to have greater market liquidity risk than higher-quality bonds, and during times of market or financial stress, market liquidity risk rises. The composition of an issuers debt and equity is referred to as its capital structure. Debt ranks ahead of all types of equity with respect to priority of payment, and within the debt component of the capital structure, there can be varying levels of seniority. With respect to priority of claims, secured debt ranks ahead of unsecured debt, and within unsecured debt, senior debt ranks ahead of subordinated debt. In the typical case, all of an issuers bonds have the same probability of default due to cross-default provisions in most indentures. Higher priority of claim implies higher recovery rate—lower loss severity—in the event of default. For issuers with more complex corporate structures—for example, a parent holding company that has operating subsidiaries—debt at the holding company is structurally subordinated to the subsidiary debt, although the possibility of more diverse assets and earnings streams from other sources could still result in the parent having higher effective credit quality than a particular subsidiary. Recovery rates can vary greatly by issuer and industry. They are influenced by the composition of an issuers capital structure, where in the economic and credit cycle the default occurred, and what the markets view of the future prospects are for the issuer and its industry. The priority of claims in bankruptcy is not always absolute. It can be influenced by several factors, including some leeway accorded to bankruptcy judges, government involvement, or a desire on the part of the more senior creditors to settle with the more junior creditors and allow the issuer to emerge from bankruptcy as a going concern, rather than risking smaller and delayed recovery in the event of a liquidation of the borrower. Credit rating agencies, such as Moodys, Standard &amp; Poors, and Fitch, play a central role in the credit markets. Nearly every bond issued in the broad debt markets carries credit ratings, which are opinions about a bond issues creditworthiness. Credit ratings enable investors to compare the credit risk of debt issues and issuers within a given industry, across industries, and across geographic markets. Bonds rated Aaa to Baa3 by Moodys and AAA to BBB– by Standard &amp; Poors (S&amp;P) and/or Fitch (higher to lower) are referred to as investment grade. Bonds rated lower than that—Ba1 or lower by Moodys and BB+ or lower by S&amp;P and/or Fitch—are referred to as below investment grade or speculative grade. Below-investment-grade bonds are also called high-yield or junk bonds. The rating agencies rate both issuers and issues. Issuer ratings are meant to address an issuers overall creditworthiness—its risk of default. Ratings for issues incorporate such factors as their rankings in the capital structure. The rating agencies will notch issue ratings up or down to account for such factors as capital structure ranking for secured or subordinated bonds, reflecting different recovery rates in the event of default. Ratings may also be notched due to structural subordination. There are risks in relying too much on credit agency ratings. Creditworthiness may change over time, and initial/current ratings do not necessarily reflect the creditworthiness of an issuer or bond over an investors holding period. Valuations often adjust before ratings change, and the notching process may not adequately reflect the price decline of a bond that is lower ranked in the capital structure. Because ratings primarily reflect the probability of default but not necessarily the severity of loss given default, bonds with the same rating may have significantly different expected losses (default probability times loss severity). And like analysts, credit rating agencies may have difficulty forecasting certain credit-negative outcomes, such as adverse litigation, leveraging corporate transactions, and such low probability/high severity events as earthquakes and hurricanes. The role of corporate credit analysis is to assess the companys ability to make timely payments of interest and to repay principal at maturity. Credit analysis is similar to equity analysis. It is important to understand, however, that bonds are contracts and that managements duty to bondholders and other creditors is limited to the terms of the contract. In contrast, managements duty to shareholders is to act in their best interest by trying to maximize the value of the company—perhaps even at the expense of bondholders at times. Credit analysts tend to focus more on the downside risk given the asymmetry of risk/return, whereas equity analysts focus more on upside opportunity from earnings growth, and so on. The 4 Cs of credit—capacity, collateral, covenants, and character—provide a useful framework for evaluating credit risk. Credit analysis focuses on an issuers ability to generate cash flow. The analysis starts with an industry assessment—structure and fundamentals—and continues with an analysis of an issuers competitive position, management strategy, and track record. Credit measures are used to calculate an issuers creditworthiness, as well as to compare its credit quality with peer companies. Key credit ratios focus on leverage and interest coverage and use such measures as EBITDA, free cash flow, funds from operations, interest expense and balance sheet debt. An issuers ability to access liquidity is also an important consideration in credit analysis. The higher the credit risk, the greater the offered/required yield and potential return demanded by investors. Over time, bonds with more credit risk offer higher returns but with greater volatility of return than bonds with lower credit risk. The yield on a credit-risky bond comprises the yield on a default risk–free bond with a comparable maturity plus a yield premium, or spread, that comprises a credit spread and a liquidity premium. That spread is intended to compensate investors for credit risk—risk of default and loss severity in the event of default—and the credit-related risks that can cause spreads to widen and prices to decline—downgrade or credit migration risk and market liquidity risk. Yield spread = Liquidity premium + Credit spread. In times of financial market stress, the liquidity premium can increase sharply, causing spreads to widen on all credit-risky bonds, with lower-quality issuers most affected. In times of credit improvement or stability, however, credit spreads can narrow sharply as well, providing attractive investment returns. Credit curves—the plot of yield spreads for a given bond issuer across the yield curve—are typically upward sloping, with the exception of high premium-priced bonds and distressed bonds, where credit curves can be inverted because of the fear of default, when all creditors at a given ranking in the capital structure will receive the same recovery rate without regard to debt maturity. The impact of spread changes on holding period returns for credit-risky bonds are a product of two primary factors: the basis point spread change and the sensitivity of price to yield as reflected by (end-of-period) modified duration and convexity. Spread narrowing enhances holding period returns, whereas spread widening has a negative impact on holding period returns. Longer-duration bonds have greater price and return sensitivity to changes in spread than shorter-duration bonds. Price impact ≈ –(MDur × ∆Spread) + ½Cvx × (∆Spread)2 For high-yield bonds, with their greater risk of default, more emphasis should be placed on an issuers sources of liquidity, as well as on its debt structure and corporate structure. Credit risk can vary greatly across an issuers debt structure depending on the seniority ranking. Many high-yield companies have complex capital structures, resulting in different levels of credit risk depending on where the debt resides. Covenant analysis is especially important for high-yield bonds. Key covenants include payment restrictions, limitation on liens, change of control, coverage maintenance tests (often limited to bank loans), and any guarantees from restricted subsidiaries. Covenant language can be very technical and legalistic, so it may help to seek legal or expert assistance. An equity-like approach to high-yield analysis can be helpful. Calculating and comparing enterprise value with EBITDA and debt/EBITDA can show a level of equity cushion or support beneath an issuers debt. Sovereign credit analysis includes assessing both an issuers ability and willingness to pay its debt obligations. Willingness to pay is important because, due to sovereign immunity, a sovereign government cannot be forced to pay its debts. In assessing sovereign credit risk, a helpful framework is to focus on five broad areas: (1) institutional effectiveness and political risks, (2) economic structure and growth prospects, (3) external liquidity and international investment position, (4) fiscal performance, flexibility, and debt burden, and (5) monetary flexibility. Among the characteristics of a high-quality sovereign credit are the absence of corruption and/or challenges to political framework; governmental checks and balances; respect for rule of law and property rights; commitment to honor debts; high per capita income with stable, broad-based growth prospects; control of a reserve or actively traded currency; currency flexibility; low foreign debt and foreign financing needs relative to receipts in foreign currencies; stable or declining ratio of debt to GDP; low debt service as a percent of revenue; low ratio of net debt to GDP; operationally independent central bank; track record of low and stable inflation; and a well-developed banking system and active money market. Non-sovereign or local government bonds, including municipal bonds, are typically either general obligation bonds or revenue bonds. General obligation (GO) bonds are backed by the taxing authority of the issuing non-sovereign government. The credit analysis of GO bonds has some similarities to sovereign analysis—debt burden per capita versus income per capita, tax burden, demographics, and economic diversity. Underfunded and off-balance-sheet liabilities, such as pensions for public employees and retirees, are debt-like in nature. Revenue-backed bonds support specific projects, such as toll roads, bridges, airports, and other infrastructure. The creditworthiness comes from the revenues generated by usage fees and tolls levied.

"The cash flow statement provides information about a companys cash receipts and cash payments during an accounting period. The cash-based information provided by the cash flow statement contrasts with the accrual-based information from the income statement. For example, the income statement reflects revenues when earned rather than when cash is collected; in contrast, the cash flow statement reflects cash receipts when collected as opposed to when the revenue was earned. A reconciliation between reported income and cash flows from operating activities provides useful information about when, whether, and how a company is able to generate cash from its operating activities. Although income is an important measure of the results of a companys activities, cash flow is also essential. As an extreme illustration, a hypothetical company that makes all sales on account, without regard to whether it will ever collect its accounts receivable, would report healthy sales on its income statement and might well report significant income; however, with zero cash inflow, the company would not survive. The cash flow statement also provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending cash on the balance sheet. In addition to information about cash generated (or, alternatively, cash used) in operating activities, the cash flow statement provides information about cash provided (or used) in a companys investing and financing activities. This information allows the analyst to answer such questions as: Does the company generate enough cash from its operations to pay for its new investments, or is the company relying on new debt issuance to finance them? Does the company pay its dividends to common stockholders using cash generated from operations, from selling assets, or from issuing debt? Answers to these questions are important because, in theory, generating cash from operations can continue indefinitely, but generating cash from selling assets, for example, is possible only as long as there are assets to sell. Similarly, generating cash from debt financing is possible only as long as lenders are willing to lend, and the lending decision depends on expectations that the company will ultimately have adequate cash to repay its obligations. In summary, information about the sources and uses of cash helps creditors, investors, and other statement users evaluate the companys liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility. This reading explains how cash flow activities are reflected in a companys cash flow statement. The reading is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the components and format of the cash flow statement, including the classification of cash flows under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the direct and indirect formats for presenting the cash flow statement. Section 3 discusses the linkages of the cash flow statement with the income statement and balance sheet and the steps in the preparation of the cash flow statement. Section 4 demonstrates the analysis of cash flow statements, including the conversion of an indirect cash flow statement to the direct method and how to use common-size cash flow analysis, free cash flow measures, and cash flow ratios used in security analysis. A summary of the key points and practice problems in the CFA Institute multiple-choice format conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: compare cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities and classify cash flow items as relating to one of those three categories given a description of the items; describe how non-cash investing and financing activities are reported; contrast cash flow statements prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP); distinguish between the direct and indirect methods of presenting cash from operating activities and describe arguments in favor of each method; describe how the cash flow statement is linked to the income statement and the balance sheet; describe the steps in the preparation of direct and indirect cash flow statements, including how cash flows can be computed using income statement and balance sheet data; convert cash flows from the indirect to direct method; analyze and interpret both reported and common-size cash flow statements; calculate and interpret free cash flow to the firm, free cash flow to equity, and performance and coverage cash flow ratios.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R3-understanding-cash-flow-statements.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/understanding-cash-flow-statements,"The cash flow statement provides important information about a companys cash receipts and cash payments during an accounting period as well as information about a companys operating, investing, and financing activities. Although the income statement provides a measure of a companys success, cash and cash flow are also vital to a companys long-term success. Information on the sources and uses of cash helps creditors, investors, and other statement users evaluate the companys liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility. Key concepts are as follows: Cash flow activities are classified into three categories: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Significant non-cash transaction activities (if present) are reported by using a supplemental disclosure note to the cash flow statement. Cash flow statements under IFRS and US GAAP are similar; however, IFRS provide companies with more choices in classifying some cash flow items as operating, investing, or financing activities. Companies can use either the direct or the indirect method for reporting their operating cash flow: The direct method discloses operating cash inflows by source (e.g., cash received from customers, cash received from investment income) and operating cash outflows by use (e.g., cash paid to suppliers, cash paid for interest) in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement. The indirect method reconciles net income to operating cash flow by adjusting net income for all non-cash items and the net changes in the operating working capital accounts. The cash flow statement is linked to a companys income statement and comparative balance sheets and to data on those statements. Although the indirect method is most commonly used by companies, an analyst can generally convert it to an approximation of the direct format by following a simple three-step process. An evaluation of a cash flow statement should involve an assessment of the sources and uses of cash and the main drivers of cash flow within each category of activities. The analyst can use common-size statement analysis for the cash flow statement. Two approaches to developing the common-size statements are the total cash inflows/total cash outflows method and the percentage of net revenues method. The cash flow statement can be used to determine free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and free cash flow to equity (FCFE). The cash flow statement may also be used in financial ratios that measure a companys profitability, performance, and financial strength.",Understanding Cash Flow Statements,2023
"Data have always been a key input for securities analysis and investment management, but the acceleration in the availability and the quantity of data has also been driving the rapid evolution of the investment industry. With the rise of big data and machine learning techniques, investment practitioners are embracing an era featuring large volume, high velocity, and a wide variety of data. This Refresher Reading invites you to explore and exploit this abundance of information for your investment strategies. While this data-rich environment offers potentially tremendous opportunities for investors, turning data into useful information is not so straightforward. Organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data are crucial to the development of successful investment strategies; otherwise, we end up with garbage in and garbage out and failed investments. It is often said that 80% of an analysts time is spent on finding, organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data, while just 20% of her/his time is taken up by model development. So, the importance of having a properly organized, cleansed, and well-analyzed dataset cannot be over-emphasized. With this essential requirement met, an appropriately executed data analysis can detect important relationships within data, uncover underlying structures, identify outliers, and extract potentially valuable insights. Utilizing both visual tools and quantitative methods, like the ones covered in this reading, is the first step in summarizing and understanding data that will be crucial inputs to an investment strategy. This reading provides a foundation for understanding important concepts that are an indispensable part of the analytical tool kit needed by investment practitioners, from junior analysts to senior portfolio managers. These basic concepts pave the way for more sophisticated tools that will be developed as the quantitative methods topic unfolds and that are integral to gaining competencies in the investment management techniques and asset classes that are presented later in the CFA curriculum. Section 2 covers core data types, including continuous and discrete numerical data, nominal and ordinal categorical data, and structured versus unstructured data. Organizing data into arrays and data tables and summarizing data in frequency distributions and contingency tables are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 introduces the important topic of data visualization using a range of charts and graphics to summarize, explore, and better understand data. Section 5 covers the key measures of central tendency, including several variants of mean that are especially useful in investments. Quantiles and their investment applications are the focus of Section 6. Key measures of dispersion are discussed in Section 7. The shape of data distributions—specifically, skewness and kurtosis—are covered in Sections 8 and 9, respectively. Section 10 provides a graphical introduction to covariance and correlation between two variables. The reading concludes with a Summary.",The member should be able to: Identify and compare data types; Describe how data are organized for quantitative analysis; Interpret frequency and related distributions; Interpret a contingency table; Describe ways that data may be visualized and evaluate uses of specific visualizations; Describe how to select among visualization types; Calculate and interpret measures of central tendency; Select among alternative definitions of mean to address an investment problem; Calculate quantiles and interpret related visualizations; Calculate and interpret measures of dispersion; Calculate and interpret target downside deviation; Interpret skewness; Interpret kurtosis; Interpret correlation between two variables.,Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V1R2-organizing-visualizing-describing-data.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/organizing-visualizing-and-describing-data,"In this reading, we have presented tools and techniques for organizing, visualizing, and describing data that permit us to convert raw data into useful information for investment analysis. Data can be defined as a collection of numbers, characters, words, and text—as well as images, audio, and video—in a raw or organized format to represent facts or information. From a statistical perspective, data can be classified as numerical data and categorical data. Numerical data (also called quantitative data) are values that represent measured or counted quantities as a number. Categorical data (also called qualitative data) are values that describe a quality or characteristic of a group of observations and usually take only a limited number of values that are mutually exclusive. Numerical data can be further split into two types: continuous data and discrete data. Continuous data can be measured and can take on any numerical value in a specified range of values. Discrete data are numerical values that result from a counting process and therefore are limited to a finite number of values. Categorical data can be further classified into two types: nominal data and ordinal data. Nominal data are categorical values that are not amenable to being organized in a logical order, while ordinal data are categorical values that can be logically ordered or ranked. Based on how they are collected, data can be categorized into three types: cross-sectional, time series, and panel. Time-series data are a sequence of observations for a single observational unit on a specific variable collected over time and at discrete and typically equally spaced intervals of time. Cross-sectional data are a list of the observations of a specific variable from multiple observational units at a given point in time. Panel data are a mix of time-series and cross-sectional data that consists of observations through time on one or more variables for multiple observational units. Based on whether or not data are in a highly organized form, they can be classified into structured and unstructured types. Structured data are highly organized in a pre-defined manner, usually with repeating patterns. Unstructured data do not follow any conventionally organized forms; they are typically alternative data as they are usually collected from unconventional sources. Raw data are typically organized into either a one-dimensional array or a two-dimensional rectangular array (also called a data table) for quantitative analysis. A frequency distribution is a tabular display of data constructed either by counting the observations of a variable by distinct values or groups or by tallying the values of a numerical variable into a set of numerically ordered bins. Frequency distributions permit us to evaluate how data are distributed. The relative frequency of observations in a bin (interval or bucket) is the number of observations in the bin divided by the total number of observations. The cumulative relative frequency cumulates (adds up) the relative frequencies as we move from the first bin to the last, thus giving the fraction of the observations that are less than the upper limit of each bin. A contingency table is a tabular format that displays the frequency distributions of two or more categorical variables simultaneously. One application of contingency tables is for evaluating the performance of a classification model (using a confusion matrix). Another application of contingency tables is to investigate a potential association between two categorical variables by performing a chi-square test of independence. Visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format for the purpose of increasing understanding and for gaining insights into the data. A histogram is a bar chart of data that have been grouped into a frequency distribution. A frequency polygon is a graph of frequency distributions obtained by drawing straight lines joining successive midpoints of bars representing the class frequencies. A bar chart is used to plot the frequency distribution of categorical data, with each bar representing a distinct category and the bars height (or length) proportional to the frequency of the corresponding category. Grouped bar charts or stacked bar charts can present the frequency distribution of multiple categorical variables simultaneously. A tree-map is a graphical tool to display categorical data. It consists of a set of colored rectangles to represent distinct groups, and the area of each rectangle is proportional to the value of the corresponding group. Additional dimensions of categorical data can be displayed by nested rectangles. A word cloud is a visual device for representing textual data, with the size of each distinct word being proportional to the frequency with which it appears in the given text. A line chart is a type of graph used to visualize ordered observations and often to display the change of data series over time. A bubble line chart is a special type of line chart that uses varying-sized bubbles as data points to represent an additional dimension of data. A scatter plot is a type of graph for visualizing the joint variation in two numerical variables. It is constructed by drawing dots to indicate the values of the two variables plotted against the corresponding axes. A scatter plot matrix organizes scatter plots between pairs of variables into a matrix format to inspect all pairwise relationships between more than two variables in one combined visual. A heat map is a type of graphic that organizes and summarizes data in a tabular format and represents it using a color spectrum. It is often used in displaying frequency distributions or visualizing the degree of correlation among different variables. The key consideration when selecting among chart types is the intended purpose of visualizing data (i.e., whether it is for exploring/presenting distributions or relationships or for making comparisons). A population is defined as all members of a specified group. A sample is a subset of a population. A parameter is any descriptive measure of a population. A sample statistic (statistic, for short) is a quantity computed from or used to describe a sample. Sample statistics—such as measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis—help with investment analysis, particularly in making probabilistic statements about returns. Measures of central tendency specify where data are centered and include the mean, median, and mode (i.e., the most frequently occurring value). The arithmetic mean is the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations. It is the most frequently used measure of central tendency. The median is the value of the middle item (or the mean of the values of the two middle items) when the items in a set are sorted into ascending or descending order. The median is not influenced by extreme values and is most useful in the case of skewed distributions. The mode is the most frequently observed value and is the only measure of central tendency that can be used with nominal data. A distribution may be unimodal (one mode), bimodal (two modes), trimodal (three modes), or have even more modes. A portfolios return is a weighted mean return computed from the returns on the individual assets, where the weight applied to each assets return is the fraction of the portfolio invested in that asset. The geometric mean, X ¯ G , of a set of observations X 1, X 2, …, Xn , is X ¯ G = X 1 X 2 X 3 … X n n , with Xi ≥ 0 for i = 1, 2, …, n. The geometric mean is especially important in reporting compound growth rates for time-series data. The geometric mean will always be less than an arithmetic mean whenever there is variance in the observations. The harmonic mean, X ¯ H , is a type of weighted mean in which an observations weight is inversely proportional to its magnitude. Quantiles—such as the median, quartiles, quintiles, deciles, and percentiles—are location parameters that divide a distribution into halves, quarters, fifths, tenths, and hundredths, respectively. A box and whiskers plot illustrates the interquartile range (the box) as well as a range outside of the box that is based on the interquartile range, indicated by the whiskers. Dispersion measures—such as the range, mean absolute deviation (MAD), variance, standard deviation, target downside deviation, and coefficient of variation—describe the variability of outcomes around the arithmetic mean. The range is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the dataset. The range has only a limited usefulness because it uses information from only two observations. The MAD for a sample is the average of the absolute deviations of observations from the mean, ∑ i = 1 n | X i − X ¯ | n , where X ¯ is the sample mean and n is the number of observations in the sample. The variance is the average of the squared deviations around the mean, and the standard deviation is the positive square root of variance. In computing sample variance (s 2) and sample standard deviation (s), the average squared deviation is computed using a divisor equal to the sample size minus 1. The target downside deviation, or target semideviation, is a measure of the risk of being below a given target. It is calculated as the square root of the average squared deviations from the target, but it includes only those observations below the target (B), or ∑ for all X i ≤ B n ( X i − B ) 2 n − 1 . The coefficient of variation, CV, is the ratio of the standard deviation of a set of observations to their mean value. By expressing the magnitude of variation among observations relative to their average size, the CV permits direct comparisons of dispersion across different datasets. Reflecting the correction for scale, the CV is a scale-free measure (i.e., it has no units of measurement). Skew or skewness describes the degree to which a distribution is asymmetric about its mean. A return distribution with positive skewness has frequent small losses and a few extreme gains compared to a normal distribution. A return distribution with negative skewness has frequent small gains and a few extreme losses compared to a normal distribution. Zero skewness indicates a symmetric distribution of returns. Kurtosis measures the combined weight of the tails of a distribution relative to the rest of the distribution. A distribution with fatter tails than the normal distribution is referred to as fat-tailed (leptokurtic); a distribution with thinner tails than the normal distribution is referred to as thin-tailed (platykurtic). Excess kurtosis is kurtosis minus 3, since 3 is the value of kurtosis for all normal distributions. The correlation coefficient is a statistic that measures the association between two variables. It is the ratio of covariance to the product of the two variables standard deviations. A positive correlation coefficient indicates that the two variables tend to move together, whereas a negative coefficient indicates that the two variables tend to move in opposite directions. Correlation does not imply causation, simply association. Issues that arise in evaluating correlation include the presence of outliers and spurious correlation.","Organizing, Visualizing, and Describing Data",2023
"Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations are increasingly being integrated into investment analysis. Evaluating how ESG factors potentially affect a company may provide analysts with a broader perspective on the risks and investment opportunities of a companys securities. Although corporate governance has long been recognized as having a significant impact on a companys long-term performance, investors have become increasingly concerned with environmental and social factors and how companies manage their resources and risk exposures that relate to such factors. Mismanagement of these resources has led to a number of high-profile corporate events that have negatively affected security prices. Increasingly stringent regulatory environments, potentially finite supplies of natural resources, and global trends toward energy conservation and waste reduction have led many investors to place greater emphasis on the management of environmental risks. Similarly, such issues as worker health and safety policies, community impact, and marketing practices have increased the visibility of how a company manages its social capital. This reading provides an overview of ESG considerations in investment analysis. Section 2 provides an overview of the global variations in corporate ownership structures, as well as how these ownership structures may affect corporate governance outcomes. In Section 3, we discuss company-specific factors that should be considered when evaluating corporate governance in the investment process. Section 4 discusses the identification of ESG-related risks and opportunities that are relevant to security analysis. Section 5 demonstrates the evaluation of ESG-related risks and opportunities through several examples. The reading concludes with a summary of the key points discussed.",The member should be able to: describe global variations in ownership structures and the possible effects of these variations on corporate governance policies and practices; evaluate the effectiveness of a companys corporate governance policies and practices; describe how ESG-related risk exposures and investment opportunities may be identified and evaluated; evaluate ESG risk exposures and investment opportunities related to a company.,Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V3R2_esg_considerations_in_investment_analysis.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/esg-considerations-investment-analysis,"Shareholder ownership structures are commonly classified as dispersed, concentrated, or a hybrid of the two. Dispersed ownership reflects the existence of many shareholders, none of which, either individually or collectively, has the ability to exercise control over the corporation. Concentrated corporate ownership reflects an individual shareholder or a group (controlling shareholders) with the ability to exercise control over the corporation. Controlling shareholders may be either majority shareholders or minority shareholders. Horizontal ownership involves companies with mutual business interests that have cross-holding share arrangements with each other. Vertical (or pyramid) ownership involves a company or group that has a controlling interest in two or more holding companies, which in turn have controlling interests in various operating companies. Dual-class (or multiple-class) shares grant one or more share classes superior or even sole voting rights while other share classes have inferior or no voting rights. Types of influential owners include banks, families, sovereign governments, institutional investors, group companies, private equity firms, foreign investors, managers, and board directors. A corporations board of directors is typically structured as either one tier or two tier. A one-tier board consists of a single board of directors, composed of executive (internal) and non-executive (external) directors. A two-tier board consists of a supervisory board that oversees a management board. CEO duality exists when the chief executive officer also serves as chairperson of the board. A primary challenge of integrating ESG factors into investment analysis is identifying and obtaining information that is relevant, comparable, and decision-useful. ESG information and metrics are inconsistently reported by companies, and such disclosure is voluntary, which provides additional challenges for analysts. In an ESG context, materiality typically refers to ESG-related issues that are expected to affect a companys operations or financial performance and the valuation of its securities. Corporate governance considerations, such as the structure of the board of directors, tend to be reasonably consistent across most companies. In contrast, environmental and social considerations often differ greatly. Analysts typically use three main sources of information to identify a companys (or industrys) ESG factors: (1) proprietary research, (2) ratings and analysis from ESG data providers, or (3) research from not-for-profit industry organizations and initiatives. In equity analysis, ESG integration is used to both identify potential opportunities and mitigate downside risk, whereas in fixed-income analysis, ESG integration is generally focused on mitigating downside risk. A typical starting point for ESG integration is the identification of material qualitative and quantitative ESG factors that pertain to a company or its industry.","Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Considerations in Investment Analysis",2024
"In a general sense, economics is the study of production, distribution, and consumption and can be divided into two broad areas of study: macroeconomics and microeconomics. Macroeconomics deals with aggregate economic quantities, such as national output and national income, and is rooted in microeconomics, which deals with markets and decision making of individual economic units, including consumers and businesses. Microeconomics is a logical starting point for the study of economics. Microeconomics classifies private economic units into two groups: consumers (or households) and firms. These two groups give rise, respectively, to the theory of the consumer and the theory of the firm as two branches of study. The theory of the consumer deals with consumption (the demand for goods and services) by utility-maximizing individuals (i.e., individuals who make decisions that maximize the satisfaction received from present and future consumption). The theory of the firm deals with the supply of goods and services by profit-maximizing firms. It is expected that candidates will be familiar with the basic concepts of demand and supply. This material is covered in detail in the recommended prerequisite readings. In this reading, we will explore how buyers and sellers interact to determine transaction prices and quantities. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the consumer or demand side of the market model, and Section 3 discusses the supply side of the consumer goods market, paying particular attention to the firms costs. Section 4 provides a summary of key points in the reading. ","The member should be able to: calculate and interpret price, income, and cross-price elasticities of demand and describe factors that affect each measure; compare substitution and income effects; distinguish between normal goods and inferior goods; describe the phenomenon of diminishing marginal returns; determine and interpret breakeven and shutdown points of production; describe how economies of scale and diseconomies of scale affect costs.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V2R1-topics-demand-supply-analysis.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/topics-demand-supply-analysis,"This reading addressed several important concepts that extend the basic market model of demand and supply to assist the analyst in assessing a firms breakeven and shutdown points of production. Demand concepts covered include own-price elasticity of demand, cross-price elasticity of demand, and income elasticity of demand. Supply concepts covered include total, average, and marginal product of labor; total, variable, and marginal cost of labor; and total and marginal revenue. These concepts are used to calculate the breakeven and shutdown points of production. Elasticity of demand is a measure of how sensitive quantity demanded is to changes in various variables. Own-price elasticity of demand is the ratio of percentage change in quantity demanded to percentage change in a good or services own price. If own-price elasticity of demand is greater than one in absolute terms, demand is elastic and a decline in price will result in higher total expenditure on that good. If own-price elasticity of demand is less than one in absolute terms, demand is inelastic and a decline in price will result in a lower total expenditure on that good. If own-price elasticity of demand is equal to negative one, demand is unit, or unitary, elastic and total expenditure on that good is independent of price. Own-price elasticity of demand will almost always be negative. Income elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change in consumer income. Demand is negatively sloped because of either the substitution effect or the income effect. The substitution effect is the phenomenon in which, as a goods price falls, more of this good is substituted for other, more expensive goods. The income effect is the phenomenon in which, as a goods price falls, real income rises and, if this good is normal, more of it will be purchased. If the good is inferior, the income effect will partially or fully offset the substitution effect. There are two exceptions to the law of demand: Giffen goods and Veblen goods. Giffen goods are highly inferior and make up a large portion of the consumer budget. As price falls, the substitution effect tends to cause more of the good to be consumed, but the highly negative income effect overwhelms the substitution effect. Demand curves for Giffen goods are positively sloped. Veblen goods are highly valued high-priced status goods; consumers may tend to buy more of a good if its price rises. If income elasticity of demand is positive, the good is a normal good. If income elasticity of demand is negative, the good is an inferior good. Cross-price elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded of one good to the percentage change in the price of a related good. If cross-price elasticity between two goods is positive, they are substitutes, and if cross-price elasticity between two goods is negative, they are complements. The law of demand states that a decrease in price will cause an increase in quantity demanded. Total product of labor is a short-run concept that is the total quantity that is able to be produced for each level of labor input, holding all other inputs constant. Average product of labor (APL) is the total product of labor divided by number of labor hours. Marginal product of labor (MPL) is the change in total product divided by the change in labor hours. MPL might rise as more labor is added to a fixed amount of capital. The law of diminishing returns dictates that additional output must fall as more and more labor is added to a fixed amount of capital. Production costs increase as input prices rise and fall as inputs become more productive. Short-run total cost (STC) is the total expenditure on fixed capital plus the total expenditure on labor. Short-run marginal cost (SMC) equals the ratio of wage to marginal product of labor (MPL). Average variable cost (AVC) is the ratio of wage to average product of labor (APL). Average total cost (ATC) is total cost (TC) divided by the number of units produced. Revenue is price times quantity sold. Marginal revenue (MR) is the ratio of change in revenue to change in output. Firms under conditions of perfect competition have no pricing power and, therefore, face a perfectly horizontal demand curve at the market price. For firms under conditions of perfect competition, price is identical to marginal revenue (MR). Firms under conditions of imperfect competition face a negatively sloped demand curve and have pricing power. For firms under conditions of imperfect competition, marginal revenue (MR) is less than price. Economic profit equals total revenue (TR) minus total economic cost, whereas accounting profit equals TR minus total accounting cost. Economic cost takes into account the total opportunity cost of all factors of production. Opportunity cost is the next best alternative forgone in making a decision. Maximum economic profit requires that (1) marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC) and (2) MC not be falling with output. The breakeven point occurs when total revenue (TR) equals total cost (TC), otherwise stated as the output quantity at which average total cost (ATC) equals price. Shutdown occurs when a firm is better off not operating than continuing to operate. If all fixed costs are sunk costs, then shutdown occurs when the market price falls below minimum average variable cost. After shutdown, the firm incurs only fixed costs and loses less money than it would operating at a price that does not cover variable costs. In the short run, it may be rational for a firm to continue to operate while earning negative economic profit if some unavoidable fixed costs are covered. Economies of scale is defined as decreasing long-run cost per unit as output increases. Diseconomies of scale is defined as increasing long-run cost per unit as output increases. Long-run average total cost is the cost of production per unit of output under conditions in which all inputs are variable. Specialization efficiencies and bargaining power in input price can lead to economies of scale. Bureaucratic and communication breakdowns and bottlenecks that raise input prices can lead to diseconomies of scale. The minimum point on the long-run average total cost curve defines the minimum efficient scale for the firm. ",Topics in Demand and Supply Analysis,2023
"Previous readings examined the risk characteristics of various fixed-income instruments and the relationships between maturity, coupon, and interest rate changes. This reading introduces fixed-income instruments created through a process known as securitization. The securitization process transfers ownership of assets such as loans or receivables from the original owners into a special legal entity. The special legal entity then issues securities, using the asset cash flows to pay interest and repay the principal to investors. These securities are referred to generically as asset-backed securities (ABS), and the pool of assets from which their cash flows are generated is called collateral or securitized assets. These loans and receivables typically include residential mortgage loans (mortgages), commercial mortgages, automobile (auto) loans, student loans, bank loans, accounts receivable, or credit card receivables. While the ABS market in the United States remains the largest in the world, securitization has recently expanded in both Asia and Europe as well as to other income-yielding assets, such as airport landing slots, toll roads, and cell tower leases. The growing depth and breadth of the global ABS market underscores the importance of a solid understanding of securitization among issuers, investors, and financial analysts. This reading describes the securitization process, discusses its benefits for both issuers and investors, and explains the investment characteristics of different types of ABS. Although investors can invest in some loan types via private credit funds or through secondary markets, securitization creates a more direct link between investors and borrowers for many types of loans and receivables. The terminology regarding ABS varies by jurisdiction. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are ABS backed by a pool of mortgages, and a distinction is sometimes made between MBS and ABS backed by non-mortgage assets. This distinction is common in the United States, for example, where typically the term mortgage-backed securities refers to securities backed by high-quality real estate mortgages and the term asset-backed securities refers to securities backed by other types of assets. Covered bonds date back to 18th century Europe and are similar to ABS, but they offer investors recourse to both the issuing financial institution and an underlying asset pool. To underline the importance of securitization from a macroeconomic perspective, we discuss the benefits of securitization for economies and financial markets. Then, we describe the structure of a securitization, identifying the parties involved and their roles as well as typical structures. We further discuss securities backed by mortgages for real estate property, including residential MBS and commercial MBS, and review two common types of non-mortgage ABS—namely, those for auto loans and credit card receivables. The reading concludes with a description of collateralized debt obligations and covered bonds. Benefits of Securitization for Economies and Financial Markets The securitization of pools of loans and receivables into multiple securities provides economies and financial markets with several benefits. Home or auto purchases have been traditionally financed by loans originated by financial institutions, such as commercial banks. For investors to gain exposure to these relatively illiquid loans, they must hold some combination of deposits, debt, or common equity issued by banks. This situation creates an additional intermediary (that is, the bank) between the borrowers and the investors. In addition, by being constrained to hold bank deposits and securities, investors cannot gain direct exposure to loans but are also affected by economic risks undertaken in other bank activities. Securitization solves a number of these problems. It allows investors to achieve more direct legal claims on loan and receivables portfolios, enabling them to tailor interest rate and credit risk exposures to suit their specific needs. Disintermediation (that is, lessening the role of intermediaries) can effectively reduce borrower costs and enhance risk-adjusted investor returns. At the same time, banks can separate loan origination from financing, improving their profitability via origination fees and reducing capital requirements for loans that are sold. Securitization enables banks to expand lending origination beyond their balance sheets, ultimately benefiting individuals, governments, and companies that need to borrow. Securitization also benefits investors by creating access to securities with profiles that match their risk, return, and maturity needs that are otherwise not directly available. For example, a pension fund with a long-term horizon can gain access to long-term real estate loans by investing in residential MBS without having to invest in bank bonds or stocks. Although few institutional or individual investors are willing to make or purchase real estate loans, auto loans, or credit card receivables directly, they may invest in a security backed by such loans or receivables. The ABS that are created by pooling these loans and receivables have characteristics similar to those of a standard bond and do not require the specialized resources and expertise needed to originate, monitor, and collect the payments from the underlying loans and receivables. As a result, investors can increase exposure to the risk–return characteristics of a wider range of underlying assets. Note that in many countries, the sale of ABS and similar instruments is restricted to investors who meet certain qualifications, such as those pertaining to net worth. Securitization allows for the creation of tradable securities with better liquidity than that of the original loans on the banks balance sheet. In making loans and receivables tradable, securitization makes financial markets more efficient. It also improves liquidity, which reduces liquidity risk in the financial system, as described later. An important benefit of securitization for companies is that ABS provide an alternative means of funding operations that can be considered alongside bond, preferred equity, and common equity issuance. Companies that originate loans and receivables that can be securitized often compare and optimize the funding costs associated with each source of financing. As we will see, securitization is often less costly than a corporate bond issue secured by the same collateral. For these reasons, securitization is beneficial to economies and financial markets and has been embraced by many sovereign governments. For example, the Italian government has used securitization since the late 1990s for privatizing public assets. In emerging markets, securitization is widely used. For example, in South America, companies and banks with high credit ratings have used securitization to sell receivables on exports, such as oil, to lower their funding costs. Although securitization brings many benefits to economies, it is not without risks, and some of these risks are widely attributed to have precipitated the turmoil in financial markets during 2007–2009. Broadly, those risks fall into two categories: risks that relate primarily to the timing of the ABSs cash flows, such as contraction risk and extension risk, and risks related to the inherent credit risk of the loans and receivables backing the ABS. This reading describes these risks and discusses some of the structures used to mitigate them as well as redistribute them. ","The member should be able to: explain benefits of securitization for economies and financial markets; describe securitization, including the parties involved in the process and the roles they play; describe typical structures of securitizations, including credit tranching and time tranching; describe types and characteristics of residential mortgage loans that are typically securitized; describe types and characteristics of residential mortgage-backed securities, including mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, and explain the cash flows and risks for each type; define prepayment risk and describe the prepayment risk of mortgage-backed securities; describe characteristics and risks of commercial mortgage-backed securities; describe types and characteristics of non-mortgage asset-backed securities, including the cash flows and risks of each type; describe collateralized debt obligations, including their cash flows and risks; describe characteristics and risks of covered bonds and how they differ from other asset-backed securities.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R13-introduction-asset-backed-securities.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/introduction-asset-backed-securities,"Securitization involves pooling debt obligations, such as loans or receivables, and creating securities backed by the pool of debt obligations called asset-backed securities (ABS). The cash flows of the debt obligations are used to make interest payments and principal repayments to the holders of the ABS. Securitization has several benefits. It allows investors direct access to liquid investments and payment streams that would be unattainable if all the financing were performed through banks. It enables banks to increase loan originations at economic scales greater than if they used only their own in-house loan portfolios. Thus, securitization contributes to lower costs of borrowing for entities raising funds, higher risk-adjusted returns to investors, and greater efficiency and profitability for the banking sector. The parties to a securitization include the seller of the collateral (pool of loans), the servicer of the loans, and the special purpose entity (SPE). The SPE is bankruptcy remote, which plays a pivotal role in the securitization. A common structure in a securitization is subordination, which leads to the creation of more than one bond class or tranche. Bond classes differ as to how they will share any losses resulting from defaults of the borrowers whose loans are in the collateral. The credit ratings assigned to the various bond classes depend on how the credit-rating agencies evaluate the credit risks of the collateral and any credit enhancements. The motivation for the creation of different types of structures is to redistribute prepayment risk and credit risk efficiently among different bond classes in the securitization. Prepayment risk is the uncertainty that the actual cash flows will be different from the scheduled cash flows as set forth in the loan agreements because borrowers may choose to repay the principal early to take advantage of interest rate movements. Because of the SPE, the securitization of a companys assets may include some bond classes that have better credit ratings than the company itself or its corporate bonds. Thus, the companys funding cost is often lower when raising funds through securitization than when issuing corporate bonds. A mortgage is a loan secured by the collateral of some specified real estate property that obliges the borrower to make a predetermined series of payments to the lender. The cash flow of a mortgage includes (1) interest, (2) scheduled principal payments, and (3) prepayments (any principal repaid in excess of the scheduled principal payment). The various mortgage designs throughout the world specify (1) the maturity of the loan; (2) how the interest rate is determined (i.e., fixed rate versus adjustable or variable rate); (3) how the principal is repaid (i.e., whether the loan is amortizing and if it is, whether it is fully amortizing or partially amortizing with a balloon payment); (4) whether the borrower has the option to prepay and if so, whether any prepayment penalties might be imposed; and (5) the rights of the lender in a foreclosure (i.e., whether the loan is a recourse or non-recourse loan). In the United States, there are three sectors for securities backed by residential mortgages: (1) those guaranteed by a federal agency (Ginnie Mae) whose securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, (2) those guaranteed by a GSE (e.g., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) but not by the US government, and (3) those issued by private entities that are not guaranteed by a federal agency or a GSE. The first two sectors are referred to as agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), and the third sector, as non-agency RMBS. A mortgage pass-through security is created when one or more holders of mortgages form a pool of mortgages and sell shares or participation certificates in the pool. The cash flow of a mortgage pass-through security depends on the cash flow of the underlying pool of mortgages and consists of monthly mortgage payments representing interest, the scheduled repayment of principal, and any prepayments, net of servicing and other administrative fees. Market participants measure the prepayment rate using two measures: the single monthly mortality rate (SMM) and its corresponding annualized rate—namely, the conditional prepayment rate (CPR). For MBS, a measure widely used by market participants to assess effective duration is the weighted average life or simply the average life of the MBS. Market participants use the Public Securities Association (PSA) prepayment benchmark to describe prepayment rates. A PSA assumption greater than 100 PSA means that prepayments are assumed to occur faster than the benchmark, whereas a PSA assumption lower than 100 PSA means that prepayments are assumed to occur slower than the benchmark. Prepayment risk includes two components: contraction risk and extension risk. The former is the risk that when interest rates decline, the security will have a shorter maturity than was anticipated at the time of purchase because homeowners will refinance at the new, lower interest rates. The latter is the risk that when interest rates rise, fewer prepayments will occur than what was anticipated at the time of purchase because homeowners are reluctant to give up the benefits of a contractual interest rate that now looks low. The creation of a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) can help manage prepayment risk by distributing the various forms of prepayment risk among different classes of bondholders. The CMOs major financial innovation is that the securities created more closely satisfy the asset/liability needs of institutional investors, thereby broadening the appeal of mortgage-backed products. The most common types of CMO tranche are sequential-pay tranches, planned amortization class (PAC) tranches, support tranches, and floating-rate tranches. Non-agency RMBS share many features and structuring techniques with agency CMOs. However, they typically include two complementary mechanisms. First, the cash flows are distributed by rules that dictate the allocation of interest payments and principal repayments to tranches with various degrees of priority/seniority. Second, there are rules for the allocation of realized losses that specify that subordinated bond classes have lower payment priority than senior classes. In order to obtain favorable credit ratings, non-agency RMBS and non-mortgage ABS often require one or more credit enhancements. The most common forms of internal credit enhancement are senior/subordinated structures, reserve funds, and overcollateralization. In external credit enhancement, credit support in the case of defaults resulting in losses in the pool of loans is provided in the form of a financial guarantee by a third party to the transaction. Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are securities backed by a pool of commercial mortgages on income-producing property. Two key indicators of the potential credit performance of CMBS are the debt-service-coverage (DSC) ratio and the loan-to-value ratio (LTV). The DSC ratio is the propertys annual net operating income divided by the debt service. CMBS have considerable call protection, which allows CMBS to trade in the market more like corporate bonds than like RMBS. This call protection comes in two forms: at the structure level and at the loan level. The creation of sequential-pay tranches is an example of call protection at the structure level. At the loan level, four mechanisms offer investors call protection: prepayment lockouts, prepayment penalty points, yield maintenance charges, and defeasance. ABS are backed by a wide range of asset types. The most popular non-mortgage ABS are auto loan ABS and credit card receivable ABS. The collateral is amortizing for auto loan ABS and non-amortizing for credit card receivable ABS. As with non-agency RMBS, these ABS must offer credit enhancement to be appealing to investors. A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is a generic term used to describe a security backed by a diversified pool of one or more debt obligations (e.g., corporate and emerging market bonds, leveraged bank loans, ABS, RMBS, and CMBS). A CDO involves the creation of an SPE. The funds necessary to pay the bond classes come from a pool of loans that must be serviced. A CDO requires a collateral manager to buy and sell debt obligations for and from the CDOs portfolio of assets to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the obligations of the CDO bondholders and to generate a fair return for the equityholders. The structure of a CDO includes senior, mezzanine, and subordinated/equity bond classes. Covered bonds are similar to ABS, but they differ because of their dual recourse nature, strict eligibility criteria, dynamic cover pool, and redemption regimes in the event of sponsor default.

"A typical economys output of goods and services fluctuates around its longer-term path. We now turn our attention to those recurring, cyclical fluctuations in economic output. Some of the factors that influence short-term changes in the economy—such as changes in population, technology, and capital—are the same as those that affect long-term sustainable economic growth. But forces that cause shifts in aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves—such as expectations, political developments, natural disasters, and fiscal and monetary policy decisions—influence economies particularly in the short run. We first describe a typical business cycle and its phases. While each cycle is different, analysts and investors need to be familiar with the typical cycle phases and what they mean for the expectations and decisions of businesses and households that influence the performance of sectors and companies. These behaviors also impact financial conditions and risk appetite, thus impacting the setting of expectations and choices of portfolio exposures to different investment sectors or styles. In the sections that follow, we describe credit cycles, introduce several theories of business cycles, and explain how different economic schools of thought interpret the business cycle and their recommendations with respect to it. We also discuss variables that demonstrate predictable relationships with the economy, focusing on those whose movements have value in predicting the future course of the economy. We then proceed to explain measures and features of unemployment and inflation. ","The member should be able to: describe the business cycle and its phases; describe credit cycles; describe how resource use, consumer and business activity, housing sector activity, and external trade sector activity vary as an economy moves through the business cycle; describe theories of the business cycle; interpret a set of economic indicators, and describe their uses and limitations; describe types of unemployment, and compare measures of unemployment; explain inflation, hyperinflation, disinflation, and deflation; explain the construction of indexes used to measure inflation; compare inflation measures, including their uses and limitations; contrast cost-push and demand-pull inflation. ",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V1R13_understanding_business_cycles.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/understanding-business-cycles,"Business cycles are recurrent expansions and contractions in economic activity affecting broad segments of the economy. Business cycles are a fundamental feature of market economies, but their amplitude and/or length vary considerably. Business cycles can be split into many different phases. The investment industry typically refers to four phases of the cycle: recovery, expansion, slowdown, and contraction, with the peak output occurring during the slowdown phase and the trough in output occurring in the recovery phase. Classical cycle refers to fluctuations in the level of economic activity when measured by GDP in volume terms. Growth cycle refers to fluctuations in economic activity around the long-term potential trend growth level with focus on how much actual economic activity is below or above trend growth in economic activity. Growth rate cycle refers to fluctuations in the growth rate of economic activity. Credit cycles describe the changing availability—and pricing—of credit. When the economy is strong or improving, the willingness of lenders to extend credit, and on favorable terms, is high. When the economy is weak or weakening, lenders pull back, or tighten credit, by making it less available and more expensive, contributing to asset values and further economic weakness and higher defaults. Credit cycles are relevant due to the importance of credit in the financing of construction and the purchase of property. The extent of business cycle fluctuations and the duration of recessions and recoveries are often shaped by linkages between business and credit cycles. Key economic variables change through the business cycle. The level of business investment shows significant changes over the cycle. Employment levels follow the cycle with a delay as companies initially use overtime before hiring after the onset of recovery and then reduce overtime before reducing employment as the economy passes its peak and enters contraction. Consumer spending, the largest component of output, follows cyclical patterns as workers make decisions based on their levels of income, wage growth, and employment outlook. Spending on consumer durables is the most cyclical consumer activity, followed by services and consumer staples, which are less affected by the cyclicality of the economy. The size of inventories is small relative to the size of the economy, but they have a much greater effect on economic growth than justified by their relatively small aggregate size relative to the economy as a whole. Inventory–sales ratio measures the inventories available for sale to the level of sales. Analysts pay attention to inventories to gauge the position of the economy in the cycle. Neoclassical and Real Business Cycle (RBC) theories focus on fluctuations of aggregate supply (AS). If AS shifts left because of an input price increase or right because of a price decrease or technical progress, the economy will gradually converge to its new equilibrium. Government intervention is generally not necessary because it may exacerbate the fluctuation or delay the convergence to equilibrium. Keynesian theories focus on fluctuations of aggregate demand (AD). If AD shifts left, Keynesians advocate government intervention to restore full employment and avoid a deflationary spiral. Monetarists argue that the timing of the impact from government policies is uncertain, and it is generally better to let the economy find its new equilibrium unassisted while ensuring that the money supply is kept growing at an even pace. Economic indicators are statistics on macroeconomic variables that help in understanding which stage of the business cycle an economy is at. Of particular importance are the leading indicators, which suggest where the economy is likely to be in the near future. No economic indicator is perfect, and many of these statistics are subject to periodic revisions. Leading economic indicators have turning points that usually precede those of the overall economy. They include survey-based indicators, such as (ISM), new orders, and average consumer expectations. They also include average weekly hours, initial claims for unemployment insurance, new building permits, the stock market index, and the difference between yields on short-term and long-term bonds. Coincident economic indicators have turning points that are usually close to those of the overall economy. They are believed to have value for identifying the economys present state. They include industrial production indexes, manufacturing and trade sales indexes, aggregate real personal income, and non-agricultural employment. Lagging economic indicators have turning points that take place later than those of the overall economy; they change after a trend has been established. They include average duration of unemployment, inventory–sales ratio, change in unit labor costs, average bank prime lending rate, commercial and industrial loans outstanding, ratio of consumer installment debt to income, and change in consumer price index for services. Policy makers and market practitioners use real-time monitoring of economic and financial variables to continuously assess current conditions and produce a nowcast. Nowcasting produces an estimate of the present state of the economy. It is useful because the actual data on such measures as GDP are only published with delay, after the end of the time period under consideration. Unemployed are those people who are actively seeking employment but are currently without a job. Long-term unemployed are those who have been out of work for a long time (more than three to four months in many countries) but are still looking for a job. Frictionally unemployed are those people who are not working at the time of filling out the statistical survey because they are taking time to search for a job that matches their skills, interests, and other preferences better than what is currently available, or people who have left one job and are about to start another job. There are different types of inflation. Hyperinflation indicates a high (e.g., 100% annual) and increasing rate of inflation; deflation indicates a negative inflation rate (prices decrease); imported inflation is associated with increasing cost of inputs that come from abroad; demand inflation is caused by constraints in production that prevent companies from making as many goods as the market demands (it is sometimes called wartime inflation, because in times of war, goods tend to be rationed). Inflation is measured by many indexes. Consumer price indexes reflect the prices of a basket of goods and services that is typically purchased by a normal household. Producer price indexes measure the cost of a basket of raw materials, intermediate inputs, and finished products. GDP deflators measure the price of the basket of goods and services produced within an economy in a given year. Core indexes exclude volatile items, such as agricultural products and energy, whose prices tend to vary more than other goods. Price levels are affected by real factors and monetary factors. Real factors include aggregate supply (an increase in supply leads to lower prices) and aggregate demand (an increase in demand leads to higher prices). Monetary factors include the supply of money (i.e., more money circulating, if the economy is in equilibrium, will lead to higher prices) and the velocity of money (i.e., higher velocity, if the economy is in equilibrium, will lead to higher prices). Economists describe two types of inflation: cost-push, in which rising costs, usually wages, compel businesses to raise prices generally; and demand-pull, in which increasing demand raises prices generally, which then are reflected in a businesss costs as workers demand wake hikes to catch up with the rising cost of living.",Understanding Business Cycles,2024
"Equity securities represent ownership claims on a companys net assets. As an asset class, equity plays a fundamental role in investment analysis and portfolio management because it represents a significant portion of many individual and institutional investment portfolios. The study of equity securities is important for many reasons. First, the decision on how much of a clients portfolio to allocate to equities affects the risk and return characteristics of the entire portfolio. Second, different types of equity securities have different ownership claims on a companys net assets, which affect their risk and return characteristics in different ways. Finally, variations in the features of equity securities are reflected in their market prices, so it is important to understand the valuation implications of these features. This reading provides an overview of equity securities and their different features and establishes the background required to analyze and value equity securities in a global context. It addresses the following questions: What distinguishes common shares from preference shares, and what purposes do these securities serve in financing a companys operations? What are convertible preference shares, and why are they often used to raise equity for unseasoned or highly risky companies? What are private equity securities, and how do they differ from public equity securities? What are depository receipts and their various types, and what is the rationale for investing in them? What are the risk factors involved in investing in equity securities? How do equity securities create company value? What is the relationship between a companys cost of equity, its return on equity, and investors required rate of return? The remainder of this reading is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of global equity markets and their historical performance. Section 3 examines the different types and characteristics of equity securities, and Section 4 outlines the differences between public and private equity securities. Section 5 provides an overview of the various types of equity securities listed and traded in global markets. Section 6 discusses the risk and return characteristics of equity securities. Section 7 examines the role of equity securities in creating company value and the relationship between a companys cost of equity, its return on equity, and investors required rate of return. The final section summarizes the reading.","The member should be able to: describe characteristics of types of equity securities; describe differences in voting rights and other ownership characteristics among different equity classes; distinguish between public and private equity securities; describe methods for investing in non-domestic equity securities; compare the risk and return characteristics of different types of equity securities; explain the role of equity securities in the financing of a companys assets; distinguish between the market value and book value of equity securities; compare a companys cost of equity, its (accounting) return on equity, and investors required rates of return.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V3R8_overview_equity_securities.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/overview-equity-securities,"Equity securities play a fundamental role in investment analysis and portfolio management.The importance of this asset class continues to grow on a global scale because ofthe need for equity capital in developed and emerging markets, technological innovation,and the growing sophistication of electronic information exchange. Given their absolutereturn potential and ability to impact the risk and return characteristics of portfolios,equity securities are of importance to both individual and institutional investors.This reading introduces equity securities and provides an overview of global equitymarkets. A detailed analysis of their historical performance shows that equity securitieshave offered average real annual returns superior to government bills and bonds, whichhave provided average real annual returns that have only kept pace with inflation.The different types and characteristics of common and preference equity securitiesare examined, and the primary differences between public and private equity securitiesare outlined. An overview of the various types of equity securities listed and tradedin global markets is provided, including a discussion of their risk and return characteristics.Finally, the role of equity securities in creating company value is examined as wellas the relationship between a companys cost of equity, its accounting return on equity,investors required rate of return, and the companys intrinsic value.We conclude with a summary of the key components of this reading: Common shares represent an ownership interest in a company and give investors a claim on its operating performance, the opportunity to participate in the corporate decision-making process, and a claim on the companys net assets in the case of liquidation. Callable common shares give the issuer the right to buy back the shares from shareholders at a price determined when the shares are originally issued. Putable common shares give shareholders the right to sell the shares back to the issuer at a price specified when the shares are originally issued. Preference shares are a form of equity in which payments made to preference shareholders take precedence over any payments made to common stockholders. Cumulative preference shares are preference shares on which dividend payments are accrued so that any payments omitted by the company must be paid before another dividend can be paid to common shareholders. Non-cumulative preference shares have no such provisions, implying that the dividend payments are at the companys discretion and are thus similar to payments made to common shareholders. Participating preference shares allow investors to receive the standard preferred dividend plus the opportunity to receive a share of corporate profits above a pre-specified amount. Non-participating preference shares allow investors to simply receive the initial investment plus any accrued dividends in the event of liquidation. Callable and putable preference shares provide issuers and investors with the same rights and obligations as their common share counterparts. Private equity securities are issued primarily to institutional investors in private placements and do not trade in secondary equity markets. There are three types of private equity investments: venture capital, leveraged buyouts, and private investments in public equity (PIPE). The objective of private equity investing is to increase the ability of the companys management to focus on its operating activities for long-term value creation. The strategy is to take the private company public after certain profit and other benchmarks have been met. Depository receipts are securities that trade like ordinary shares on a local exchange but which represent an economic interest in a foreign company. They allow the publicly listed shares of foreign companies to be traded on an exchange outside their domestic market. American depository receipts are US dollar-denominated securities trading much like standard US securities on US markets. Global depository receipts are similar to ADRs but contain certain restrictions in terms of their ability to be resold among investors. Underlying characteristics of equity securities can greatly affect their risk and return. A companys accounting return on equity is the total return that it earns on shareholders book equity. A companys cost of equity is the minimum rate of return that stockholders require the company to pay them for investing in its equity.",Overview of Equity Securities,2024
"The balance sheet provides information on a companys resources (assets) and its sources of capital (equity and liabilities/debt). This information helps an analyst assess a companys ability to pay for its near-term operating needs, meet future debt obligations, and make distributions to owners. The basic equation underlying the balance sheet is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Analysts should be aware that different types of assets and liabilities may be measured differently. For example, some items are measured at historical cost or a variation thereof and others at fair value. An understanding of the measurement issues will facilitate analysis. The balance sheet measurement issues are, of course, closely linked to the revenue and expense recognition issues affecting the income statement. Throughout this reading, we describe and illustrate some of the linkages between the measurement issues affecting the balance sheet and the revenue and expense recognition issues affecting the income statement. This reading is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe and give examples of the elements and formats of balance sheets. Section 3 discusses current assets and current liabilities. Section 4 focuses on assets, and Section 5 focuses on liabilities. Section 6 describes the components of equity and illustrates the statement of changes in shareholders equity. Section 7 introduces balance sheet analysis.

Equity is the owners residual interest in the assets of a company, net of its liabilities. The amount of equity is increased by income earned during the year, or by the issuance of new equity. The amount of equity is decreased by losses, by dividend payments, or by share repurchases. An understanding of the balance sheet enables an analyst to evaluate the liquidity, solvency, and overall financial position of a company. The balance sheet distinguishes between current and non-current assets and between current and non-current liabilities unless a presentation based on liquidity provides more relevant and reliable information. The concept of liquidity relates to a companys ability to pay for its near-term operating needs. With respect to a company overall, liquidity refers to the availability of cash to pay those near-term needs. With respect to a particular asset or liability, liquidity refers to its nearness to cash. Some assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of fair value and some are measured at historical cost. Notes to financial statements provide information that is helpful in assessing the comparability of measurement bases across companies. Assets expected to be liquidated or used up within one year or one operating cycle of the business, whichever is greater, are classified as current assets. Assets not expected to be liquidated or used up within one year or one operating cycle of the business, whichever is greater, are classified as non-current assets. Liabilities expected to be settled or paid within one year or one operating cycle of the business, whichever is greater, are classified as current liabilities. Liabilities not expected to be settled or paid within one year or one operating cycle of the business, whichever is greater, are classified as non-current liabilities. Trade receivables, also referred to as accounts receivable, are amounts owed to a company by its customers for products and services already delivered. Receivables are reported net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventories are physical products that will eventually be sold to the companys customers, either in their current form (finished goods) or as inputs into a process to manufacture a final product (raw materials and work-in-process). Inventories are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value. If the net realizable value of a companys inventory falls below its carrying amount, the company must write down the value of the inventory and record an expense. Inventory cost is based on specific identification or estimated using the first-in, first-out or weighted average cost methods. Some accounting standards (including US GAAP but not IFRS) also allow last-in, first-out as an additional inventory valuation method. Accounts payable, also called trade payables, are amounts that a business owes its vendors for purchases of goods and services. Deferred revenue (also known as unearned revenue) arises when a company receives payment in advance of delivery of the goods and services associated with the payment received. Property, plant, and equipment (PPE) are tangible assets that are used in company operations and expected to be used over more than one fiscal period. Examples of tangible assets include land, buildings, equipment, machinery, furniture, and natural resources such as mineral and petroleum resources. IFRS provide companies with the choice to report PPE using either a historical cost model or a revaluation model. US GAAP permit only the historical cost model for reporting PPE. Depreciation is the process of recognizing the cost of a long-lived asset over its useful life. (Land is not depreciated.) Under IFRS, property used to earn rental income or capital appreciation is considered to be an investment property. IFRS provide companies with the choice to report an investment property using either a historical cost model or a fair value model. Intangible assets refer to identifiable non-monetary assets without physical substance. Examples include patents, licenses, and trademarks. For each intangible asset, a company assesses whether the useful life is finite or indefinite. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortised on a systematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life, with the amortisation method and useful-life estimate reviewed at least annually. Impairment principles for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are the same as for PPE. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortised. Instead, it is tested for impairment at least annually. For internally generated intangible assets, IFRS require that costs incurred during the research phase must be expensed. Costs incurred in the development stage can be capitalized as intangible assets if certain criteria are met, including technological feasibility, the ability to use or sell the resulting asset, and the ability to complete the project. The most common intangible asset that is not a separately identifiable asset is goodwill, which arises in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortised; instead it is tested for impairment at least annually. Financial instruments are contracts that give rise to both a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. In general, there are two basic alternative ways that financial instruments are measured: fair value or amortised cost. For financial instruments measured at fair value, there are two basic alternatives in how net changes in fair value are recognized: as profit or loss on the income statement, or as other comprehensive income (loss) which bypasses the income statement. Typical long-term financial liabilities include loans (i.e., borrowings from banks) and notes or bonds payable (i.e., fixed-income securities issued to investors). Liabilities such as bonds issued by a company are usually reported at amortised cost on the balance sheet. Deferred tax liabilities arise from temporary timing differences between a companys income as reported for tax purposes and income as reported for financial statement purposes. Six potential components that comprise the owners equity section of the balance sheet include: contributed capital, preferred shares, treasury shares, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and non-controlling interest. The statement of changes in equity reflects information about the increases or decreases in each component of a companys equity over a period. Vertical common-size analysis of the balance sheet involves stating each balance sheet item as a percentage of total assets. Balance sheet ratios include liquidity ratios (measuring the companys ability to meet its short-term obligations) and solvency ratios (measuring the companys ability to meet long-term and other obligations).",Understanding Balance Sheets,2023
"Merchandising and manufacturing companies generate revenues and profits through the sale of inventory. Further, inventory may represent a significant asset on these companies balance sheets. Merchandisers (wholesalers and retailers) purchase inventory, ready for sale, from manufacturers and thus account for only one type of inventory—finished goods inventory. Manufacturers, however, purchase raw materials from suppliers and then add value by transforming the raw materials into finished goods. They typically classify inventory into three different categories: raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods. Work-in-progress inventories have started the conversion process from raw materials but are not yet finished goods ready for sale. Manufacturers may report either the separate carrying amounts of their raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods inventories on the balance sheet or simply the total inventory amount. If the latter approach is used, the company must then disclose the carrying amounts of its raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods inventories in a footnote to the financial statements. Inventories and cost of sales (cost of goods sold) are significant items in the financial statements of many companies. Comparing the performance of these companies is challenging because of the allowable choices for valuing inventories: Differences in the choice of inventory valuation method can result in significantly different amounts being assigned to inventory and cost of sales. Financial statement analysis would be much easier if all companies used the same inventory valuation method or if inventory price levels remained constant over time. If there was no inflation or deflation with respect to inventory costs and thus unit costs were unchanged, the choice of inventory valuation method would be irrelevant. However, inventory price levels typically do change over time. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) permit the assignment of inventory costs (costs of goods available for sale) to inventories and cost of sales by three cost formulas: specific identification, first-in, first-out (FIFO), and weighted average cost. US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) allow the same three inventory valuation methods, referred to as cost flow assumptions in US GAAP, but also include a fourth method called last-in, first-out (LIFO). The choice of inventory valuation method affects the allocation of the cost of goods available for sale to ending inventory and cost of sales. Analysts must understand the various inventory valuation methods and the related impact on financial statements and financial ratios in order to evaluate a companys performance over time and relative to industry peers. The companys financial statements and related notes provide important information that the analyst can use in assessing the impact of the choice of inventory valuation method on financial statements and financial ratios. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the costs that are included in inventory and the costs that are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Section 3 describes inventory valuation methods and compares the measurement of ending inventory, cost of sales and gross profit under each method, and when using periodic versus perpetual inventory systems. Section 4 describes the LIFO method, LIFO reserve, and effects of LIFO liquidations, and demonstrates the adjustments required to compare a company that uses LIFO with one that uses FIFO. Section 5 describes the financial statement effects of a change in inventory valuation method. Section 6 discusses the measurement and reporting of inventory when its value changes. Section 7 describes the presentation of inventories on the financial statements and related disclosures, discusses inventory ratios and their interpretation, and shows examples of financial analysis with respect to inventories. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: distinguish between costs included in inventories and costs recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred; describe different inventory valuation methods (cost formulas); calculate and compare cost of sales, gross profit, and ending inventory using different inventory valuation methods and using perpetual and periodic inventory systems; calculate and explain how inflation and deflation of inventory costs affect the financial statements and ratios of companies that use different inventory valuation methods; explain LIFO reserve and LIFO liquidation and their effects on financial statements and ratios; convert a companys reported financial statements from LIFO to FIFO for purposes of comparison; describe the measurement of inventory at the lower of cost and net realisable value; describe implications of valuing inventory at net realisable value for financial statements and ratios; describe the financial statement presentation of and disclosures relating to inventories; explain issues that analysts should consider when examining a companys inventory disclosures and other sources of information; calculate and compare ratios of companies, including companies that use different inventory methods; analyze and compare the financial statements of companies, including companies that use different inventory methods.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R5-inventories.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/inventories,"The choice of inventory valuation method (cost formula or cost flow assumption) can have a potentially significant impact on inventory carrying amounts and cost of sales. These in turn impact other financial statement items, such as current assets, total assets, gross profit, and net income. The financial statements and accompanying notes provide important information about a companys inventory accounting policies that the analyst needs to correctly assess financial performance and compare it with that of other companies. Key concepts in this reading are as follows: Inventories are a major factor in the analysis of merchandising and manufacturing companies. Such companies generate their sales and profits through inventory transactions on a regular basis. An important consideration in determining profits for these companies is measuring the cost of sales when inventories are sold. The total cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Storage costs of finished inventory and abnormal costs due to waste are typically treated as expenses in the period in which they occurred. The allowable inventory valuation methods implicitly involve different assumptions about cost flows. The choice of inventory valuation method determines how the cost of goods available for sale during the period is allocated between inventory and cost of sales. IFRS allow three inventory valuation methods (cost formulas): first-in, first-out (FIFO); weighted average cost; and specific identification. The specific identification method is used for inventories of items that are not ordinarily interchangeable and for goods or services produced and segregated for specific projects. US GAAP allow the three methods above plus the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The LIFO method is widely used in the United States for both tax and financial reporting purposes because of potential income tax savings. The choice of inventory method affects the financial statements and any financial ratios that are based on them. As a consequence, the analyst must carefully consider inventory valuation method differences when evaluating a companys performance over time or in comparison to industry data or industry competitors. A company must use the same cost formula for all inventories having a similar nature and use to the entity. The inventory accounting system (perpetual or periodic) may result in different values for cost of sales and ending inventory when the weighted average cost or LIFO inventory valuation method is used. Under US GAAP, companies that use the LIFO method must disclose in their financial notes the amount of the LIFO reserve or the amount that would have been reported in inventory if the FIFO method had been used. This information can be used to adjust reported LIFO inventory and cost of goods sold balances to the FIFO method for comparison purposes. LIFO liquidation occurs when the number of units in ending inventory declines from the number of units that were present at the beginning of the year. If inventory unit costs have generally risen from year to year, this will produce an inventory-related increase in gross profits. Consistency of inventory costing is required under both IFRS and US GAAP. If a company changes an accounting policy, the change must be justifiable and applied retrospectively to the financial statements. An exception to the retrospective restatement is when a company reporting under US GAAP changes to the LIFO method. Under IFRS, inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Under US GAAP, inventories are measured at the lower of cost, market value, or net realisable value depending upon the inventory method used. Market value is defined as current replacement cost subject to an upper limit of net realizable value and a lower limit of net realizable value less a normal profit margin. Reversals of previous write-downs are permissible under IFRS but not under US GAAP. Reversals of inventory write-downs may occur under IFRS but are not allowed under US GAAP. Changes in the carrying amounts within inventory classifications (such as raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods) may provide signals about a companys future sales and profits. Relevant information with respect to inventory management and future sales may be found in the Management Discussion and Analysis or similar items within the annual or quarterly reports, industry news and publications, and industry economic data. The inventory turnover ratio, number of days of inventory ratio, and gross profit margin ratio are useful in evaluating the management of a companys inventory. Inventory management may have a substantial impact on a companys activity, profitability, liquidity, and solvency ratios. It is critical for the analyst to be aware of industry trends and managements intentions. Financial statement disclosures provide information regarding the accounting policies adopted in measuring inventories, the principal uncertainties regarding the use of estimates related to inventories, and details of the inventory carrying amounts and costs. This information can greatly assist analysts in their evaluation of a companys inventory management.",Inventories,2023
"Financial analysis is the process of examining a companys performance in the context of its industry and economic environment in order to arrive at a decision or recommendation. Often, the decisions and recommendations addressed by financial analysts pertain to providing capital to companies—specifically, whether to invest in the companys debt or equity securities and at what price. An investor in debt securities is concerned about the companys ability to pay interest and to repay the principal lent. An investor in equity securities is an owner with a residual interest in the company and is concerned about the companys ability to pay dividends and the likelihood that its share price will increase. Overall, a central focus of financial analysis is evaluating the companys ability to earn a return on its capital that is at least equal to the cost of that capital, to profitably grow its operations, and to generate enough cash to meet obligations and pursue opportunities. Fundamental financial analysis starts with the information found in a companys financial reports. These financial reports include audited financial statements, additional disclosures required by regulatory authorities, and any accompanying (unaudited) commentary by management. Basic financial statement analysis—as presented in this reading—provides a foundation that enables the analyst to better understand other information gathered from research beyond the financial reports. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the scope of financial statement analysis. Section 3 describes the sources of information used in financial statement analysis, including the primary financial statements (statement of financial position or balance sheet, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement). Section 4 provides a framework for guiding the financial statement analysis process.

An analyst may be called on to perform a financial analysis for a variety of reasons, including the valuation of equity securities, the assessment of credit risk, the performance of due diligence on an acquisition, and the evaluation of a subsidiarys performance relative to other business units. Major considerations in both equity analysis and credit analysis are evaluating a companys financial position, its ability to generate profits and cash flow, and its potential to generate future growth in profits and cash flow. This reading has presented an overview of financial statement analysis. Among the major points covered are the following: The primary purpose of financial reports is to provide information and data about a companys financial position and performance, including profitability and cash flows. The information presented in the reports —including the financial statements and notes and managements commentary or managements discussion and analysis—allows the financial analyst to assess a companys financial position and performance and trends in that performance. The primary financial statements are the statement of financial position (i.e., the balance sheet), the statement of comprehensive income (or two statements consisting of an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income), the statement of changes in equity, and the statement of cash flows. The balance sheet discloses what resources a company controls (assets) and what it owes (liabilities) at a specific point in time. Owners equity represents the net assets of the company; it is the owners residual interest in, or residual claim on, the companys assets after deducting its liabilities. The relationship among the three parts of the balance sheet (assets, liabilities, and owners equity) may be shown in equation form as follows: Assets = Liabilities + Owners equity. The income statement presents information on the financial results of a companys business activities over a period of time. The income statement communicates how much revenue and other income the company generated during a period and what expenses, including losses, it incurred in connection with generating that revenue and other income. The basic equation underlying the income statement is Revenue + Other income – Expenses = Net income. The statement of comprehensive income includes all items that change owners equity except transactions with owners. Some of these items are included as part of net income, and some are reported as other comprehensive income (OCI). The statement of changes in equity provides information about increases or decreases in the various components of owners equity. Although the income statement and balance sheet provide measures of a companys success, cash and cash flow are also vital to a companys long-term success. Disclosing the sources and uses of cash helps creditors, investors, and other statement users evaluate the companys liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility. The notes (also referred to as footnotes) that accompany the financial statements are an integral part of those statements and provide information that is essential to understanding the statements. Analysts should evaluate note disclosures regarding the use of alternative accounting methods, estimates, and assumptions. In addition to the financial statements, a company provides other sources of information that are useful to the financial analyst. As part of his or her analysis, the financial analyst should read and assess this additional information, particularly that presented in the management commentary (also called management report[ing], operating and financial review, and managements discussion and analysis [MD&amp;A]). A publicly traded company must have an independent audit performed on its annual financial statements. The auditors report expresses an opinion on the financial statements and provides some assurance about whether the financial statements fairly present a companys financial position, performance, and cash flows. In addition, for US publicly traded companies, auditors must also express an opinion on the companys internal control systems. Information on the economy, industry, and peer companies is useful in putting the companys financial performance and position in perspective and in assessing the companys future. In most cases, information from sources apart from the company are crucial to an analysts effectiveness. The financial statement analysis framework provides steps that can be followed in any financial statement analysis project. These steps are: articulate the purpose and context of the analysis; collect input data; process data; analyze/interpret the processed data; develop and communicate conclusions and recommendations; and follow up.",Introduction to Financial Statement Analysis,2024
"Investors gather and analyze vast amounts of information about security markets on a continual basis. Because this work can be both time consuming and data intensive, investors often use a single measure that consolidates this information and reflects the performance of an entire security market. Security market indexes were first introduced as a simple measure to reflect the performance of the US stock market. Since then, security market indexes have evolved into important multi-purpose tools that help investors track the performance of various security markets, estimate risk, and evaluate the performance of investment managers. They also form the basis for new investment products. in·dex, noun (pl. in·dex·es or in·di·ces) Latin indic-, index, from indicare to indicate: an indicator, sign, or measure of something. Origin of Market Indexes Investors had access to regularly published data on individual security prices in London as early as 1698, but nearly 200 years passed before they had access to a simple indicator to reflect security market information. To give readers a sense of how the US stock market in general performed on a given day, publishers Charles H. Dow and Edward D. Jones introduced the Dow Jones Average, the worlds first security market index, in 1884. The index, which appeared in The Customers Afternoon Letter, consisted of the stocks of nine railroads and two industrial companies. It eventually became the Dow Jones Transportation Average. Convinced that industrial companies, rather than railroads, would be the great speculative market of the future, Dow and Jones introduced a second index in May 1896—the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). It had an initial value of 40.94 and consisted of 12 stocks from major US industries. Today, investors can choose from among thousands of indexes to measure and monitor different security markets and asset classes. This reading is organized as follows.

It also discusses various types of indexes. Security market indexesare invaluable tools for investors, who can select from among thousands of indexesrepresenting a variety of security markets, market segments, and asset classes. Theseindexes range from those representing the global market for major asset classes tothose representing alternative investments in specific geographic markets. To benefitfrom the use of security market indexes, investors must understand their constructionand determine whether the selected index is appropriate for their purposes. Frequently,an index that is well suited for one purpose may not be well suited for other purposes.Users of indexes must be familiar with how various indexes are constructed in orderto select the index or indexes most appropriate for their needs.Among the key points made in this reading are the following: Security market indexes are intended to measure the values of different target markets (security markets, market segments, or asset classes). The constituent securities selected for inclusion in the security market index are intended to represent the target market. A price return index reflects only the prices of the constituent securities. A total return index reflects not only the prices of the constituent securities but also the reinvestment of all income received since the inception of the index. Methods used to weight the constituents of an index range from the very simple, such as price and equal weightings, to the more complex, such as market-capitalization and fundamental weightings. Choices in index construction—in particular, the choice of weighting method—affect index valuation and returns. Index management includes 1) periodic rebalancing to ensure that the index maintains appropriate weightings and 2) reconstitution to ensure the index represents the desired target market. Rebalancing and reconstitution create turnover in an index. Reconstitution can dramatically affect prices of current and prospective constituents. Indexes serve a variety of purposes. They gauge market sentiment and serve as benchmarks for actively managed portfolios. They act as proxies for measuring systematic risk and risk-adjusted performance. They also serve as proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models and as model portfolios for investment products. Investors can choose from security market indexes representing various asset classes, including equity, fixed-income, commodity, real estate, and hedge fund indexes. Within most asset classes, index providers offer a wide variety of indexes, ranging from broad market indexes to highly specialized indexes based on the issuers geographic region, economic development group, or economic sector or other factors. Proper use of security market indexes depends on understanding their construction and management.",Security Market Indexes,2024
"The economic decisions of households can have a significant impact on an economy. For example, a decision on the part of households to consume more and to save less can lead to an increase in employment, investment, and ultimately profits. Equally, the investment decisions made by corporations can have an important impact on the real economy and on corporate profits. But individual corporations can rarely affect large economies on their own; the decisions of a single household concerning consumption will have a negligible impact on the wider economy. By contrast, the decisions made by governments can have an enormous impact on even the largest and most developed of economies for two main reasons. First, the public sectors of most developed economies normally employ a significant proportion of the population, and they are usually responsible for a significant proportion of spending in an economy. Second, governments are also the largest borrowers in world debt markets. Government policy is ultimately expressed through its borrowing and spending activities. In this reading, we identify and discuss two types of government policy that can affect the macroeconomy and financial markets: monetary policy and fiscal policy. Monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. By contrast, fiscal policy refers to the governments decisions about taxation and spending. Both monetary and fiscal policies are used to regulate economic activity over time. They can be used to accelerate growth when an economy starts to slow or to moderate growth and activity when an economy starts to overheat. In addition, fiscal policy can be used to redistribute income and wealth. The overarching goal of both monetary and fiscal policy is normally the creation of an economic environment where growth is stable and positive and inflation is stable and low. Crucially, the aim is therefore to steer the underlying economy so that it does not experience economic booms that may be followed by extended periods of low or negative growth and high levels of unemployment. In such a stable economic environment, householders can feel secure in their consumption and saving decisions, while corporations can concentrate on their investment decisions, on making their regular coupon payments to their bond holders and on making profits for their shareholders. The challenges to achieving this overarching goal are many. Not only are economies frequently buffeted by shocks (such as oil price jumps), but some economists believe that natural cycles in the economy also exist. Moreover, there are plenty of examples from history where government policies—either monetary, fiscal, or both—have exacerbated an economic expansion that eventually led to damaging consequences for the real economy, for financial markets, and for investors. The balance of the reading is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an introduction to monetary policy and related topics. Section 3 presents fiscal policy. The interactions between monetary policy and fiscal policy are the subject of Section 4. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading. ","The member should be able to: compare monetary and fiscal policy; describe functions and definitions of money; explain the money creation process; describe theories of the demand for and supply of money; describe the Fisher effect; describe roles and objectives of central banks; contrast the costs of expected and unexpected inflation; describe tools used to implement monetary policy; describe the monetary transmission mechanism; describe qualities of effective central banks; explain the relationships between monetary policy and economic growth, inflation, interest, and exchange rates; contrast the use of inflation, interest rate, and exchange rate targeting by central banks; determine whether a monetary policy is expansionary or contractionary; describe limitations of monetary policy; describe roles and objectives of fiscal policy; describe tools of fiscal policy, including their advantages and disadvantages; describe the arguments about whether the size of a national debt relative to GDP matters; explain the implementation of fiscal policy and difficulties of implementation; determine whether a fiscal policy is expansionary or contractionary; explain the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V2R5-monetary-fiscal-policy.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/monetary-fiscal-policy,"In this reading, we have sought to explain the practices of both monetary and fiscal policy. Both can have a significant impact on economic activity, and it is for this reason that financial analysts need to be aware of the tools of both monetary and fiscal policy, the goals of the monetary and fiscal authorities, and most important the monetary and fiscal policy transmission mechanisms. Governments can influence the performance of their economies by using combinations of monetary and fiscal policy. Monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. By contrast, fiscal policy refers to the governments decisions about taxation and spending. The two sets of policies affect the economy via different mechanisms. Money fulfills three important functions: It acts as a medium of exchange, provides individuals with a way of storing wealth, and provides society with a convenient unit of account. Via the process of fractional reserve banking, the banking system can create money. The amount of wealth that the citizens of an economy choose to hold in the form of money—as opposed to, for example, bonds or equities—is known as the demand for money. There are three basic motives for holding money: transactions-related, precautionary, and speculative. The addition of 1 unit of additional reserves to a fractional reserve banking system can support an expansion of the money supply by an amount equal to the money multiplier, defined as 1/reserve requirement (stated as a decimal). The nominal rate of interest is comprised of three components: a real required rate of return, a component to compensate lenders for future inflation, and a risk premium to compensate lenders for uncertainty (e.g., about the future rate of inflation). Central banks take on multiple roles in modern economies. They are usually the monopoly supplier of their currency, the lender of last resort to the banking sector, the governments bank and bank of the banks, and they often supervise banks. Although they may express their objectives in different ways, the overarching objective of most central banks is price stability. For a central bank to be able to implement monetary policy objectively, it should have a degree of independence from government, be credible, and be transparent in its goals and objectives. The ultimate challenge for central banks as they try to manipulate the supply of money to influence the economy is that they cannot control the amount of money that households and corporations put in banks on deposit, nor can they easily control the willingness of banks to create money by expanding credit. Taken together, this also means that they cannot always control the money supply. Therefore, there are definite limits to the power of monetary policy. The concept of money neutrality is usually interpreted as meaning that money cannot influence the real economy in the long run. However, by the setting of its policy rate, a central bank hopes to influence the real economy via the policy rates impact on other market interest rates, asset prices, the exchange rate, and the expectations of economic agents. Inflation targeting is the most common monetary policy—although exchange rate targeting is also used, particularly in developing economies. Quantitative easing attempts to spur aggregate demand by drastically increasing the money supply. Fiscal policy involves the use of government spending and revenue raising (taxation) to impact a number of aspects of the economy: the overall level of aggregate demand in an economy and hence the level of economic activity; the distribution of income and wealth among different segments of the population; and hence ultimately the allocation of resources between different sectors and economic agents. The tools that governments use in implementing fiscal policy are related to the way in which they raise revenue and the different forms of expenditure. Governments usually raise money via a combination of direct and indirect taxes. Government expenditure can be current on goods and services or can take the form of capital expenditure, for example, on infrastructure projects. As economic growth weakens, or when it is in recession, a government can enact an expansionary fiscal policy—for example, by raising expenditure without an offsetting increase in taxation. Conversely, by reducing expenditure and maintaining tax revenues, a contractionary policy might reduce economic activity. Fiscal policy can therefore play an important role in stabilizing an economy. Although both fiscal and monetary policy can alter aggregate demand, they work through different channels, the policies are therefore not interchangeable, and they conceivably can work against one another unless the government and central bank coordinate their objectives.

"This reading presents elementary topics in leverage. Leverage is the use of fixed costs in a companys cost structure. Fixed costs that are operating costs (such as depreciation or rent) create operating leverage. Fixed costs that are financial costs (such as interest expense) create financial leverage. Analysts refer to the use of fixed costs as leverage because fixed costs act as a fulcrum for the companys earnings. Leverage can magnify earnings both up and down. The profits of highly leveraged companies might soar with small upturns in revenue. But the reverse is also true: Small downturns in revenue may lead to losses. Analysts need to understand a companys use of leverage for three main reasons. First, the degree of leverage is an important component in assessing a companys risk and return characteristics. Second, analysts may be able to discern information about a companys business and future prospects from managements decisions about the use of operating and financial leverage. Knowing how to interpret these signals also helps the analyst evaluate the quality of managements decisions. Third, the valuation of a company requires forecasting future cash flows and assessing the risk associated with those cash flows. Understanding a companys use of leverage should help in forecasting cash flows and in selecting an appropriate discount rate for finding their present value. The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces leverage and defines important terms. Section 3 illustrates and discusses measures of operating leverage and financial leverage, which combine to define a measure of total leverage that gauges the sensitivity of net income to a given percent change in units sold. This section also covers breakeven points in using leverage and corporate reorganization (a possible consequence of using leverage inappropriately). A summary and practice problems conclude this reading. ","The member should be able to: define and explain leverage, business risk, sales risk, operating risk, and financial risk and classify a risk; calculate and interpret the degree of operating leverage, the degree of financial leverage, and the degree of total leverage; analyze the effect of financial leverage on a companys net income and return on equity; calculate the breakeven quantity of sales and determine the companys net income at various sales levels; calculate and interpret the operating breakeven quantity of sales.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R3-measures-leverage.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/measures-leverage,"In this reading, we have reviewed the fundamentals of business risk, financial risk, and measures of leverage. Leverage is the use of fixed costs in a companys cost structure. Business risk is the risk associated with operating earnings and reflects both sales risk (uncertainty with respect to the price and quantity of sales) and operating risk (the risk related to the use of fixed costs in operations). Financial risk is the risk associated with how a company finances its operations (i.e., the split between equity and debt financing of the business). The degree of operating leverage (DOL) is the ratio of the percentage change in operating income to the percentage change in units sold. We can use the following formula to measure the degree of operating leverage: DOL=Q(P−V)Q(P−V)−F The degree of financial leverage (DFL) is the percentage change in net income for a one percent change in operating income. We can use the following formula to measure the degree of financial leverage: DFL=[Q(P−V)−F](1−t)[Q(P−V)−F−C](1−t)=[Q(P−V)−F][Q(P−V)−F−C] The degree of total leverage (DTL) is a measure of the sensitivity of net income to changes in unit sales, which is equivalent to DTL = DOL × DFL. The breakeven point, QBE, is the number of units produced and sold at which the companys net income is zero, which we calculate as QBE=F+CP−V The operating breakeven point, QOBE, is the number of units produced and sold at which the companys operating income is zero, which we calculate as ",Measures of Leverage,2023
"Financial analysts gather and process information to make investment decisions, including those related to buying and selling assets. Generally, the decisions involve trading securities, currencies, contracts, commodities, and real assets such as real estate. Consider several examples: Fixed income analysts evaluate issuer credit-worthiness and macroeconomic prospects to determine which bonds and notes to buy or sell to preserve capital while obtaining a fair rate of return. Stock analysts study corporate values to determine which stocks to buy or sell to maximize the value of their stock portfolios. Corporate treasurers analyze exchange rates, interest rates, and credit conditions to determine which currencies to trade and which notes to buy or sell to have funds available in a needed currency. Risk managers work for producers or users of commodities to calculate how many commodity futures contracts to buy or sell to manage inventory risks. Financial analysts must understand the characteristics of the markets in which their decisions will be executed. This reading, by examining those markets from the analysts perspective, provides that understanding. This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 examines the functions of the financial system. Section 3 introduces assets that investors, information-motivated traders, and risk managers use to advance their financial objectives and presents ways practitioners classify these assets into markets. These assets include such financial instruments as securities, currencies, and some contracts; certain commodities; and real assets. Financial analysts must know the distinctive characteristics of these trading assets. Section 4 is an overview of financial intermediaries (entities that facilitate the functioning of the financial system). Section 5 discusses the positions that can be obtained while trading assets. You will learn about the benefits and risks of long and short positions, how these positions can be financed, and how the financing affects their risks. Section 6 discusses how market participants order trades and how markets process those orders. These processes must be understood to achieve trading objectives while controlling transaction costs. Section 7 focuses on describing primary markets. Section 8 describes the structures of secondary markets in securities. Sections 9 and 10 close the reading with discussions of the characteristics of a well-functioning financial system and of how regulation helps make financial markets function better.

Financial analysts need to understandhow the financial system works because their analyses often lead to trading decisions.The financial system consists of markets and the financial intermediaries that operatein them. These institutions allow buyers to connect with sellers. They may trade directlywith each other when they trade the same instrument or they only may trade indirectlywhen a financial intermediary connects the buyer to the seller through transactionswith each that appear on the intermediarys balance sheet. The buyer and seller mayexchange instruments, cash flows, or risks.The following points, among others, were made in this reading: The financial system consists of mechanisms that allow strangers to contract with each other to move money through time, to hedge risks, and to exchange assets that they value less for those that they value more. Investors move money from the present to the future when they save. They expect a normal rate of return for bearing risk through time. Borrowers move money from the future to the present to fund current projects and expenditures. Hedgers trade to reduce their exposure to risks they prefer not to take. Information-motivated traders are active investment managers who try to identify under- and overvalued instruments. Securities are first sold in primary markets by their issuers. They then trade in secondary markets. People invest in pooled investment vehicles to benefit from the investment management services of their managers. Forward contracts allow buyers and sellers to arrange for future sales at predetermined prices. Futures contracts are forward contracts guaranteed by clearinghouses. The guarantee ensures that strangers are willing to trade with each other and that traders can offset their positions by trading with anybody. These features of futures contract markets make them highly attractive to hedgers and information-motivated traders. Many financial intermediaries connect buyers to sellers in a given instrument, acting directly as brokers and exchanges or indirectly as dealers and arbitrageurs. Financial intermediaries create instruments when they conduct arbitrage, securitize assets, borrow to lend, manage investment funds, or pool insurance contracts. These activities all transform cash flows and risks from one form to another. Their services allow buyers and sellers to connect with each other through instruments that meet their specific needs. Financial markets work best when strangers can contract with each other without worrying about whether their counterparts are able and willing to honor their contract. Clearinghouses, variation margins, maintenance margins, and settlement guarantees made by creditworthy brokers on behalf of their clients help manage credit risk and ultimately allow strangers to contract with each other. Information-motivated traders short sell when they expect that prices will fall. Hedgers short sell to reduce the risks of a long position in a related contract or commodity. Margin loans allow people to buy more securities than their equity would otherwise permit them to buy. The larger positions expose them to more risk so that gains and losses for a given amount of equity will be larger. The leverage ratio is the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it. The returns to the equity in a position are equal to the leverage ratio times the returns to the unleveraged position. To protect against credit losses, brokers demand maintenance margin payments from their customers who have borrowed cash or securities when adverse price changes cause their customers equity to drop below the maintenance margin ratio. Brokers close positions for customers who do not satisfy these margin calls. Orders are instructions to trade. They always specify instrument, side (buy or sell), and quantity. They usually also provide several other instructions. Market orders tend to fill quickly but often at inferior prices. Limit orders generally fill at better prices if they fill, but they may not fill. Traders choose order submission strategies on the basis of how quickly they want to trade, the prices they are willing to accept, and the consequences of failing to trade. Stop instructions are attached to other orders to delay efforts to fill them until the stop condition is satisfied. Although stop orders are often used to stop losses, they are not always effective. Issuers sell their securities using underwritten public offerings, best efforts public offerings, private placements, shelf registrations, dividend reinvestment programs, and rights offerings. Investment banks have a conflict of interests when setting the initial offering price in an IPO. Well-functioning secondary markets are essential to raising capital in the primary markets because investors value the ability to sell their securities if they no longer want to hold them or if they need to disinvest to raise cash. If they cannot trade their securities in a liquid market, they will not pay as much for them. Matching buyers and sellers in call markets is easy because the traders (or their orders) come together at the same time and place. Dealers provide liquidity in quote-driven markets. Public traders as well as dealers provide liquidity in order-driven markets. Order-driven markets arrange trades by ranking orders using precedence rules. The rules generally ensure that traders who provide the best prices, display the most size, and arrive early trade first. Continuous order-driven markets price orders using the discriminatory pricing rule. Under this rule, standing limit orders determine trade prices. Brokers help people trade unique instruments or positions for which finding a buyer or a seller is difficult. Transaction costs are lower in transparent markets than in opaque markets because traders can more easily determine market value and more easily manage their trading in transparent markets. A well-functioning financial system allows people to trade instruments that best solve their wealth and risk management problems with low transaction costs. Complete and liquid markets characterize a well-functioning financial system. Complete markets are markets in which the instruments needed to solve investment and risk management problems are available to trade. Liquid markets are markets in which traders can trade when they want to trade at low cost. The financial system is operationally efficient when its markets are liquid. Liquid markets lower the costs of raising capital. A well-functioning financial system promotes wealth by ensuring that capital allocation decisions are well made. A well-functioning financial system also promotes wealth by allowing people to share the risks associated with valuable products that would otherwise not be undertaken. Prices are informationally efficient when they reflect all available information about fundamental values. Information-motivated traders make prices informationally efficient. Prices will be most informative in liquid markets because information-motivated traders will not invest in information and research if establishing positions based on their analyses is too costly. Regulators generally seek to promote fair and orderly markets in which traders can trade at prices that accurately reflect fundamental values without incurring excessive transaction costs. Governmental agencies and self-regulating organizations of practitioners provide regulatory services that attempt to make markets safer and more efficient. Mandated financial disclosure programs for the issuers of publicly traded securities ensure that information necessary to estimate security values is available to financial analysts on a consistent basis.",Market Organization and Structure,2024
" Long-lived assets, also referred to as non-current assets or long-term assets, are assets that are expected to provide economic benefits over a future period of time, typically greater than one year. Long-lived assets may be tangible, intangible, or financial assets. Examples of long-lived tangible assets, typically referred to as and sometimes as fixed assets, include land, buildings, furniture and fixtures, machinery and equipment, and vehicles; examples of long-lived (assets lacking physical substance) include patents and trademarks; and examples of long-lived financial assets include investments in equity or debt securities issued by other entities. The scope of this reading is limited to long-lived tangible and intangible assets (hereafter, referred to for simplicity as long-lived assets). The first issue in accounting for a long-lived asset is determining its cost at acquisition. The second issue is how to allocate the cost to expense over time. The costs of most long-lived assets are capitalised and then allocated as expenses in the profit or loss (income) statement over the period of time during which they are expected to provide economic benefits. The two main types of long-lived assets with costs that are typically not allocated over time are land, which is not depreciated, and those intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Additional issues that arise are the treatment of subsequent costs incurred related to the asset, the use of the cost model versus the revaluation model, unexpected declines in the value of the asset, classification of the asset with respect to intent (for example, held for use or held for sale), and the derecognition of the asset. This reading is organised as follows. Section 2 describes and illustrates accounting for the acquisition of long-lived assets, with particular attention to the impact of capitalizing versus expensing expenditures. Section 3 describes the allocation of the costs of long-lived assets over their useful lives. Section 4 discusses the revaluation model that is based on changes in the fair value of an asset. Section 5 covers the concepts of impairment (unexpected decline in the value of an asset). Section 6 describes accounting for the derecognition of long-lived assets. Section 7 describes financial statement presentation, disclosures, and analysis of long-lived assets. Section 8 discusses differences in financial reporting of investment property compared with property, plant, and equipment. A summary is followed by practice problems.","The member should be able to: distinguish between costs that are capitalised and costs that are expensed in the period in which they are incurred; compare the financial reporting of the following types of intangible assets: purchased, internally developed, acquired in a business combination; explain and evaluate how capitalising versus expensing costs in the period in which they are incurred affects financial statements and ratios; describe the different depreciation methods for property, plant, and equipment and calculate depreciation expense; describe how the choice of depreciation method and assumptions concerning useful life and residual value affect depreciation expense, financial statements, and ratios; describe the different amortisation methods for intangible assets with finite lives and calculate amortisation expense; describe how the choice of amortisation method and assumptions concerning useful life and residual value affect amortisation expense, financial statements, and ratios; describe the revaluation model; explain the impairment of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets; explain the derecognition of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets; explain and evaluate how impairment, revaluation, and derecognition of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets affect financial statements and ratios; describe the financial statement presentation of and disclosures relating to property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets; analyze and interpret financial statement disclosures regarding property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets; compare the financial reporting of investment property with that of property, plant, and equipment.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R6-long-lived-assets.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/long-lived-assets,"Understanding the reporting of long-lived assets at inception requires distinguishing between expenditures that are capitalised (i.e., reported as long-lived assets) and those that are expensed. Once a long-lived asset is recognised, it is reported under the cost model at its historical cost less accumulated depreciation (amortisation) and less any impairment or under the revaluation model at its fair value. IFRS permit the use of either the cost model or the revaluation model, whereas US GAAP require the use of the cost model. Most companies reporting under IFRS use the cost model. The choice of different methods to depreciate (amortise) long-lived assets can create challenges for analysts comparing companies. Key points include the following: Expenditures related to long-lived assets are capitalised as part of the cost of assets if they are expected to provide future benefits, typically beyond one year. Otherwise, expenditures related to long-lived assets are expensed as incurred. Although capitalising expenditures, rather than expensing them, results in higher reported profitability in the initial year, it results in lower profitability in subsequent years; however, if a company continues to purchase similar or increasing amounts of assets each year, the profitability-enhancing effect of capitalisation continues. Capitalising an expenditure rather than expensing it results in a greater amount reported as cash from operations because capitalised expenditures are classified as an investing cash outflow rather than an operating cash outflow. Companies must capitalise interest costs associated with acquiring or constructing an asset that requires a long period of time to prepare for its intended use. Including capitalised interest in the calculation of interest coverage ratios provides a better assessment of a companys solvency. IFRS require research costs be expensed but allow all development costs (not only software development costs) to be capitalised under certain conditions. Generally, US accounting standards require that research and development costs be expensed; however, certain costs related to software development are required to be capitalised. When one company acquires another company, the transaction is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in which the company identified as the acquirer allocates the purchase price to each asset acquired (and each liability assumed) on the basis of its fair value. Under acquisition accounting, if the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the sum of the amounts that can be allocated to individual identifiable assets and liabilities, the excess is recorded as goodwill. The capitalised costs of long-lived tangible assets and of intangible assets with finite useful lives are allocated to expense in subsequent periods over their useful lives. For tangible assets, this process is referred to as depreciation, and for intangible assets, it is referred to as amortisation. Long-lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised but are reviewed for impairment annually. Impairment disclosures can provide useful information about a companys expected cash flows. Methods of calculating depreciation or amortisation expense include the straight-line method, in which the cost of an asset is allocated to expense in equal amounts each year over its useful life; accelerated methods, in which the allocation of cost is greater in earlier years; and the units-of-production method, in which the allocation of cost corresponds to the actual use of an asset in a particular period. Estimates required for depreciation and amortisation calculations include the useful life of the equipment (or its total lifetime productive capacity) and its expected residual value at the end of that useful life. A longer useful life and higher expected residual value result in a smaller amount of annual depreciation relative to a shorter useful life and lower expected residual value. IFRS permit the use of either the cost model or the revaluation model for the valuation and reporting of long-lived assets, but the revaluation model is not allowed under US GAAP. Under the revaluation model, carrying amounts are the fair values at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation or amortisation. In contrast with depreciation and amortisation charges, which serve to allocate the cost of a long-lived asset over its useful life, impairment charges reflect an unexpected decline in the fair value of an asset to an amount lower than its carrying amount. IFRS permit impairment losses to be reversed, with the reversal reported in profit. US GAAP do not permit the reversal of impairment losses. The gain or loss on the sale of long-lived assets is computed as the sales proceeds minus the carrying amount of the asset at the time of sale. Estimates of average age and remaining useful life of a companys assets reflect the relationship between assets accounted for on a historical cost basis and depreciation amounts. The average remaining useful life of a companys assets can be estimated as net PPE divided by depreciation expense, although the accounting useful life may not necessarily correspond to the economic useful life. Long-lived assets reclassified as held for sale cease to be depreciated or amortised. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by a sale (e.g., by abandonment, exchange for another asset, or distribution to owners in a spin-off) are classified as held for use until disposal. Thus, they continue to be depreciated and tested for impairment. Investment property is defined as property that is owned (or, in some cases, leased under a finance lease) for the purpose of earning rentals, capital appreciation, or both. Under IFRS, companies are allowed to value investment properties using either a cost model or a fair value model. The cost model is identical to the cost model used for property, plant, and equipment, but the fair value model differs from the revaluation model used for property, plant, and equipment. Unlike the revaluation model, under the fair value model, all changes in the fair value of investment property affect net income. Under US GAAP, investment properties are generally measured using the cost model.",Long-Lived Assets,2023
"Financial reporting standards provide principles for preparing financial reports and determine the types and amounts of information that must be provided to users of financial statements, including investors and creditors, so that they may make informed decisions. This reading focuses on the context within which these standards are created. An understanding of the underlying framework of financial reporting standards, which is broader than knowledge of specific accounting rules, will allow an analyst to assess the valuation implications of financial statement elements and transactions—including transactions, such as those that represent new developments, which are not specifically addressed by the standards. Section 2 of this reading discusses the objective of financial reporting and the importance of financial reporting standards in security analysis and valuation. Section 3 describes the roles of financial reporting standard-setting bodies and regulatory authorities and several of the financial reporting standard-setting bodies and regulatory authorities.

This reading describes the conceptual objectives of financial reporting standards, the parties involved in standard-setting processes, and the implication for analysts in monitoring developments in reporting standards. Some key points of the reading are summarized below: The objective of financial reporting is to provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders, and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the entity. Financial reporting requires policy choices and estimates. These choices and estimates require judgment, which can vary from one preparer to the next. Accordingly, standards are needed to ensure increased consistency in these judgments. Private sector standard setting bodies and regulatory authorities play significant but different roles in the standard setting process. In general, standard setting bodies make the rules, and regulatory authorities enforce the rules. However, regulators typically retain legal authority to establish financial reporting standards in their jurisdiction. The IFRS framework sets forth the concepts that underlie the preparation and presentation of financial statements for external users. The objective of fair presentation of useful information is the center of the IASBs Conceptual Framework. The qualitative characteristics of useful information include fundamental and enhancing characteristics. Information must exhibit the fundamental characteristics of relevance and faithful representation to be useful. The enhancing characteristics identified are comparability, verifiability, timeliness, and understandability. IFRS Financial Statements: IAS No. 1 prescribes that a complete set of financial statements includes a statement of financial position (balance sheet), a statement of comprehensive income (either two statements—one for net income and one for comprehensive income—or a single statement combining both net income and comprehensive income), a statement of changes in equity, a cash flow statement, and notes. The notes include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Financial statements need to reflect certain basic features: fair presentation, going concern, accrual basis, materiality and aggregation, and no offsetting. Financial statements must be prepared at least annually, must include comparative information from the previous period, and must be consistent. Financial statements must follow certain presentation requirements including a classified statement of financial position (balance sheet) and minimum information on both the face of the financial statements and in the notes. A significant number of the worlds listed companies report under either IFRS or US GAAP. In many cases, a user of financial statements will lack the information necessary to make specific adjustments required to achieve comparability between companies that use IFRS and companies that use US GAAP. Instead, an analyst must maintain general caution in interpreting comparative financial measures produced under different accounting standards and monitor significant developments in financial reporting standards. Analysts can remain aware of ongoing developments in financial reporting by monitoring new products or types of transactions; actions of standard setters, regulators, and other groups; and company disclosures regarding critical accounting policies and estimates.",Financial Reporting Standards,2023
"Market efficiency concerns the extent to which market prices incorporate available information. If market prices do not fully incorporate information, then opportunities may exist to make a profit from the gathering and processing of information. The subject of market efficiency is, therefore, of great interest to investment managers, as illustrated in Example 1. Example 1 Market Efficiency and Active Manager Selection The chief investment officer (CIO) of a major university endowment fund has listed eight steps in the active manager selection process that can be applied both to traditional investments (e.g., common equity and fixed-income securities) and to alternative investments (e.g., private equity, hedge funds, and real assets). The first step specified is the evaluation of market opportunity: What is the opportunity and why is it there? To answer this question, we start by studying capital markets and the types of managers operating within those markets. We identify market inefficiencies and try to understand their causes, such as regulatory structures or behavioral biases. We can rule out many broad groups of managers and strategies by simply determining that the degree of market inefficiency necessary to support a strategy is implausible. Importantly, we consider the past history of active returns meaningless unless we understand why markets will allow those active returns to continue into the future. The CIOs description underscores the importance of not assuming that past active returns that might be found in a historical dataset will repeat themselves in the future. refer to returns earned by strategies that do not assume that all information is fully reflected in market prices. Governments and market regulators also care about the extent to which market prices incorporate information. Efficient markets imply informative prices—prices that accurately reflect available information about fundamental values. In market-based economies, market prices help determine which companies (and which projects) obtain capital. If these prices do not efficiently incorporate information about a companys prospects, then it is possible that funds will be misdirected. By contrast, prices that are informative help direct scarce resources and funds available for investment to their highest-valued uses. Informative prices thus promote economic growth. The efficiency of a countrys capital markets (in which businesses raise financing) is an important characteristic of a well-functioning financial system. The remainder of this reading is organized as follows. Section 2 provides specifics on how the efficiency of an asset market is described and discusses the factors affecting (i.e., contributing to and impeding) market efficiency. Section 3 presents an influential three-way classification of the efficiency of security markets and discusses its implications for fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and portfolio management. Section 4 presents several market anomalies (apparent market inefficiencies that have received enough attention to be individually identified and named) and describes how these anomalies relate to investment strategies. Section 5 introduces behavioral finance and how that field of study relates to market efficiency. A summary concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: The candidate should be able to: describe market efficiency and related concepts, including their importance to investment practitioners; distinguish between market value and intrinsic value; explain factors that affect a markets efficiency; contrast weak-form, semi-strong-form, and strong-form market efficiency; explain the implications of each form of market efficiency for fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and the choice between active and passive portfolio management; describe market anomalies; describe behavioral finance and its potential relevance to understanding market anomalies.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V3R7_market_efficiency.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/market-efficiency,"This reading has provided an overview of the theory and evidence regarding marketefficiency and has discussed the different forms of market efficiency as well as theimplications for fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and portfolio management.The general conclusion drawn from the efficient market hypothesis is that it is notpossible to beat the market on a consistent basis by generating returns in excessof those expected for the level of risk of the investment.Additional key points include the following: The efficiency of a market is affected by the number of market participants and depth of analyst coverage, information availability, and limits to trading. There are three forms of efficient markets, each based on what is considered to be the information used in determining asset prices. In the weak form, asset prices fully reflect all market data, which refers to all past price and trading volume information. In the semi-strong form, asset prices reflect all publicly known and available information. In the strong form, asset prices fully reflect all information, which includes both public and private information. Intrinsic value refers to the true value of an asset, whereas market value refers to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold. When markets are efficient, the two should be the same or very close. But when markets are not efficient, the two can diverge significantly. Most empirical evidence supports the idea that securities markets in developed countries are semi-strong-form efficient; however, empirical evidence does not support the strong form of the efficient market hypothesis. A number of anomalies have been documented that contradict the notion of market efficiency, including the size anomaly, the January anomaly, and the winners–losers anomalies. In most cases, however, contradictory evidence both supports and refutes the anomaly. Behavioral finance uses human psychology, such as behavioral biases, in an attempt to explain investment decisions. Whereas behavioral finance is helpful in understanding observed decisions, a market can still be considered efficient even if market participants exhibit seemingly irrational behaviors, such as herding.",Market Efficiency,2024
"Ideally, analysts would always have access to financial reports that are based on sound financial reporting standards, such as those from the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and are free from manipulation. But, in practice, the quality of financial reports can vary greatly. High-quality financial reporting provides information that is useful to analysts in assessing a companys performance and prospects. Low-quality financial reporting contains inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete information. Extreme lapses in financial reporting quality have given rise to high-profile scandals that resulted not only in investor losses but also in reduced confidence in the financial system. Financial statement users who were able to accurately assess financial reporting quality were better positioned to avoid losses. These lapses illustrate the challenges analysts face as well as the potential costs of failing to recognize practices that result in misleading or inaccurate financial reports. Examples of misreporting can provide an analyst with insight into various signals that may indicate poor-quality financial reports. This reading addresses financial reporting quality, which pertains to the quality of information in financial reports, including disclosures in notes. High-quality reporting provides decision-useful information, which is relevant and faithfully represents the economic reality of the companys activities during the reporting period as well as the companys financial condition at the end of the period. A separate but interrelated attribute of quality is quality of reported results or earnings quality, which pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the companys actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition. The term earnings quality is commonly used in practice and will be used broadly to encompass the quality of earnings, cash flow, and/or balance sheet items. High-quality earnings result from activities that a company will likely be able to sustain in the future and provide a sufficient return on the companys investment. The concepts of earnings quality and financial reporting quality are interrelated because a correct assessment of earnings quality is possible only when there is some basic level of financial reporting quality. Beyond this basic level, as the quality of reporting increases, the ability of financial statement users to correctly assess earnings quality and to develop expectations for future performance arguably also increases. Section 2 provides a conceptual overview of reporting quality. Section 3 discusses motivations that might cause, and conditions that might enable, management to issue financial reports that are not high quality and mechanisms that aim to provide discipline to financial reporting quality. Section 4 describes choices made by management that can affect financial reporting quality—presentation choices, accounting methods, and estimates—as well as warning signs of poor-quality financial reporting.","The member should be able to: distinguish between financial reporting quality and quality of reported results (including quality of earnings, cash flow, and balance sheet items); describe a spectrum for assessing financial reporting quality; distinguish between conservative and aggressive accounting; describe motivations that might cause management to issue financial reports that are not high quality; describe conditions that are conducive to issuing low-quality, or even fraudulent, financial reports; describe mechanisms that discipline financial reporting quality and the potential limitations of those mechanisms; describe presentation choices, including non-GAAP measures, that could be used to influence an analysts opinion; describe accounting methods (choices and estimates) that could be used to manage earnings, cash flow, and balance sheet items; describe accounting warning signs and methods for detecting manipulation of information in financial reports.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V3R2_financial_reporting_quality.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/financial-reporting-quality,"Financial reporting quality varies across companies. The ability to assess the quality of a companys financial reporting is an important skill for analysts. Indications of low-quality financial reporting can prompt an analyst to maintain heightened skepticism when reading a companys reports, to review disclosures critically when undertaking financial statement analysis, and to incorporate appropriate adjustments in assessments of past performance and forecasts of future performance. Financial reporting quality can be thought of as spanning a continuum from the highest (containing information that is relevant, correct, complete, and unbiased) to the lowest (containing information that is not just biased or incomplete but possibly pure fabrication). Reporting quality, the focus of this reading, pertains to the information disclosed. High-quality reporting represents the economic reality of the companys activities during the reporting period and the companys financial condition at the end of the period. Results quality (commonly referred to as earnings quality) pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the companys actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition, relative to expectations of current and future financial performance. Quality earnings are regarded as being sustainable, providing a sound platform for forecasts. An aspect of financial reporting quality is the degree to which accounting choices are conservative or aggressive. Aggressive typically refers to choices that aim to enhance the companys reported performance and financial position by inflating the amount of revenues, earnings, and/or operating cash flow reported in the period; or by decreasing expenses for the period and/or the amount of debt reported on the balance sheet. Conservatism in financial reports can result from either (1) accounting standards that specifically require a conservative treatment of a transaction or an event or (2) judgments made by managers when applying accounting standards that result in conservative results. Managers may be motivated to issue less-than-high-quality financial reports in order to mask poor performance, to boost the stock price, to increase personal compensation, and/or to avoid violation of debt covenants. Conditions that are conducive to the issuance of low-quality financial reports include a cultural environment that result in fewer or less transparent financial disclosures, book/tax conformity that shifts emphasis toward legal compliance and away from fair presentation, and limited capital markets regulation. Mechanisms that discipline financial reporting quality include the free market and incentives for companies to minimize cost of capital, auditors, contract provisions specifically tailored to penalize misreporting, and enforcement by regulatory entities. Pro forma earnings (also commonly referred to as non-GAAP or non-IFRS earnings) adjust earnings as reported on the income statement. Pro forma earnings that exclude negative items are a hallmark of aggressive presentation choices. Companies are required to make additional disclosures when presenting any non-GAAP or non-IFRS metric. Managers considerable flexibility in choosing their companies accounting policies and in formulating estimates provides opportunities for aggressive accounting. Examples of accounting choices that affect earnings and balance sheets include inventory cost flow assumptions, estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable, estimated realizability of deferred tax assets, depreciation method, estimated salvage value of depreciable assets, and estimated useful life of depreciable assets. Cash from operations is a metric of interest to investors that can be enhanced by operating choices, such as stretching accounts payable, and potentially by classification choices.",Financial Reporting Quality,2024
"Global investors must address two fundamentally interrelated questions: where to invest and in what asset classes? Some countries may be attractive from an equity perspective because of their strong economic growth and the profitability of particular domestic sectors or industries. Other countries may be attractive from a fixed income perspective because of their interest rate environment and price stability. To identify markets that are expected to provide attractive investment opportunities, investors must analyze cross-country differences in such factors as expected GDP growth rates, monetary and fiscal policies, trade policies, and competitiveness. From a longer term perspective investors also need to consider such factors as a countrys stage of economic and financial market development, demographics, quality and quantity of physical and human capital (accumulated education and training of workers), and its area(s) of comparative advantage. This reading provides a framework for analyzing a countrys trade and capital flows and their economic implications. International trade can facilitate economic growth by increasing the efficiency of resource allocation, providing access to larger capital and product markets, and facilitating specialization based on comparative advantage. The flow of financial capital (funds available for investment) between countries with excess savings and those where financial capital is scarce can increase liquidity, raise output, and lower the cost of capital. From an investment perspective, it is important to understand the complex and dynamic nature of international trade and capital flows because investment opportunities are increasingly exposed to the forces of global competition for markets, capital, and ideas. This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 defines basic terminology used in the reading and describes patterns and trends in international trade and capital flows. It also discusses the benefits of international trade, distinguishes between absolute and comparative advantage, and explains two traditional models of comparative advantage. Section 3 describes trade restrictions and their implications and discusses the motivation for, and advantages of, trade agreements. Section 4 describes the balance of payments and Section 5 discusses the function and objectives of international organizations that facilitate trade. A summary of key points and practice problems conclude the reading. ","The member should be able to: compare gross domestic product and gross national product; describe benefits and costs of international trade; distinguish between comparative advantage and absolute advantage; compare the Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin models of trade and the source(s) of comparative advantage in each model; compare types of trade and capital restrictions and their economic implications; explain motivations for and advantages of trading blocs, common markets, and economic unions; describe common objectives of capital restrictions imposed by governments; describe the balance of payments accounts including their components; explain how decisions by consumers, firms, and governments affect the balance of payments; describe functions and objectives of the international organizations that facilitate trade, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization.

It examines basic models that explain trade based on comparative advantage and provides a basis for understanding how international trade can affect the rate and composition of economic growth as well as the attractiveness of investment in various sectors. The benefits of trade include gains from exchange and specialization; gains from economies of scale as companies add new markets for their products; greater variety of products available to households and firms; and increased competition and more efficient allocation of resources. A country has an absolute advantage in producing a good (or service) if it is able to produce that good at a lower absolute cost or use fewer resources in its production than its trading partner. A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good if its opportunity cost of producing that good is less than that of its trading partner. Even if a country does not have an absolute advantage in the production of any good, it can gain from trade by producing and exporting the good(s) in which it has a comparative advantage and importing good(s) in which it has a comparative disadvantage. In the Ricardian model of trade, comparative advantage and the pattern of trade are determined by differences in technology between countries. In the Heckscher–Ohlin model of trade, comparative advantage and the pattern of trade are determined by differences in factor endowments between countries. In reality, technology and factor endowments are complementary, not mutually exclusive, determinants of trade patterns. Trade barriers prevent the free flow of goods and services among countries. Governments impose trade barriers for various reasons including: to promote specific developmental objectives, to counteract certain imperfections in the functioning of markets, or to respond to problems facing their economies. For purposes of international trade policy and analysis, a small country is defined as one that cannot affect the world price of traded goods. A large countrys production and/or consumption decisions do alter the relative prices of trade goods. In a small country, trade barriers generate a net welfare loss arising from distortion of production and consumption decisions and the associated inefficient allocation of resources. Trade barriers can generate a net welfare gain in a large country if the gain from improving its terms of trade (higher export prices and lower import prices) more than offsets the loss from the distortion of resource allocations. However, the large country can only gain if it imposes an even larger welfare loss on its trading partner(s). An import tariff and an import quota have the same effect on price, production, and trade. With a quota, however, some or all of the revenue that would be raised by the equivalent tariff is instead captured by foreign producers (or the foreign government) as quota rents. Thus, the welfare loss suffered by the importing country is generally greater with a quota. A voluntary export restraint is imposed by the exporting country. It has the same impact on the importing country as an import quota from which foreigners capture all of the quota rents. An export subsidy encourages firms to export their product rather than sell it in the domestic market. The distortion of production, consumption, and trade decisions generates a welfare loss. The welfare loss is greater for a large country because increased production and export of the subsidized product reduces its global price—that is, worsens the countrys terms of trade. Capital restrictions are defined as controls placed on foreigners ability to own domestic assets and/or domestic residents ability to own foreign assets. In contrast to trade restrictions, which limit the openness of goods markets, capital restrictions limit the openness of financial markets. A regional trading bloc is a group of countries who have signed an agreement to reduce and progressively eliminate barriers to trade and movement of factors of production among the members of the bloc. They may or may not have common trade barriers against those countries that are not members of the bloc. In a free trade area all barriers to the flow of goods and services among members are eliminated, but each country maintains its own polices against non-members. A customs union extends the FTA by not only allowing free movement of goods and services among members but also creating a common trade policy against non-members. A common market incorporates all aspects of a customs union and extends it by allowing free movement of factors of production among members. An economic union incorporates all aspects of a common market and requires common economic institutions and coordination of economic policies among members. Members of a monetary union adopt a common currency. From an investment perspective, it is important to understand the complex and dynamic nature of trading relationships because they can help identify potential profitable investment opportunities as well as provide some advance warning signals regarding when to disinvest in a market or industry. The major components of the balance of payments are the current account balance, which largely reflects trade in goods and services. capital account balance, which mainly consists of capital transfers and net sales of non-produced, non-financial assets. financial account, which measures net capital flows based on sales and purchases of domestic and foreign financial assets. Decisions by consumers, firms, and governments influence the balance of payments. Low private savings and/or high investment tend to produce a current account deficit that must be financed by net capital imports; high private savings and/or low investment, however, produce a current account surplus, balanced by net capital exports. All else the same, a government deficit produces a current account deficit and a government surplus leads to a current account surplus. All else the same, a sustained current account deficit contributes to a rise in the risk premium for financial assets of the deficit country. Current account surplus countries tend to enjoy lower risk premiums than current account deficit countries. Created after WWII, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization are the three major international organizations that provide necessary stability to the international monetary system and facilitate international trade and development. The IMFs mission is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system, the system of exchange rates and international payments that enables countries to buy goods and services from each other. The IMF helps to keep country-specific market risk and global systemic risk under control. The World Bank helps to create the basic economic infrastructure essential for creation and maintenance of domestic financial markets and a well-functioning financial industry in developing countries. The World Trade Organizations mission is to foster free trade by providing a major institutional and regulatory framework of global trade rules without which todays global multinational corporations would be hard to conceive.

"Analysts gather and process information to make investment decisions, including buy and sell recommendations. What information is gathered and how it is processed depend on the analyst and the purpose of the analysis. Technical analysis uses such information as stock price and trading volume as the basis for investment decisions. Fundamental analysis uses information about the economy, industry, and company as the basis for investment decisions. Examples of fundamentals are unemployment rates, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, industry growth, and quality of and growth in company earnings. Whereas technical analysts use information to predict price movements and base investment decisions on the direction of predicted change in prices, fundamental analysts use information to estimate the value of a security and to compare the estimated value to the market price and then base investment decisions on that comparison. This reading introduces equity valuation models used to estimate the intrinsic value (synonym: fundamental value) of a security; intrinsic value is based on an analysis of investment fundamentals and characteristics. The fundamentals to be considered depend on the analysts approach to valuation. In a top-down approach, an analyst examines the economic environment, identifies sectors that are expected to prosper in that environment, and analyzes securities of companies from previously identified attractive sectors. In a bottom-up approach, an analyst typically follows an industry or industries and forecasts fundamentals for the companies in those industries in order to determine valuation. Whatever the approach, an analyst who estimates the intrinsic value of an equity security is implicitly questioning the accuracy of the market price as an estimate of value. Valuation is particularly important in active equity portfolio management, which aims to improve on the return–risk trade-off of a portfolios benchmark by identifying mispriced securities. This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the implications of differences between estimated value and market price. Section 3 introduces three major categories of valuation model. Section 4 presents an overview of present value models with a focus on the dividend discount model. Section 5 describes and examines the use of multiples in valuation. Section 6 explains asset-based valuation and demonstrates how these models can be used to estimate value. Section 7 states conclusions and summarizes the reading.","The member should be able to: evaluate whether a security, given its current market price and a value estimate, is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued by the market; describe major categories of equity valuation models; describe regular cash dividends, extra dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, and share repurchases; describe dividend payment chronology; explain the rationale for using present value models to value equity and describe the dividend discount and free-cash-flow-to-equity models; calculate the intrinsic value of a non-callable, non-convertible preferred stock; calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of an equity security based on the Gordon (constant) growth dividend discount model or a two-stage dividend discount model, as appropriate; identify characteristics of companies for which the constant growth or a multistage dividend discount model is appropriate; explain the rationale for using price multiples to value equity, how the price to earnings multiple relates to fundamentals, and the use of multiples based on comparables; calculate and interpret the following multiples: price to earnings, price to an estimate of operating cash flow, price to sales, and price to book value; describe enterprise value multiples and their use in estimating equity value; describe asset-based valuation models and their use in estimating equity value; explain advantages and disadvantages of each category of valuation model.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V3R12_equity_valuation_concepts_basic_tools.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/equity-valuation-concepts-basic-tools,"The equity valuation models used to estimate intrinsic value—present value models,multiplier models, and asset-based valuation—are widely used and serve an importantpurpose. The valuation models presented here are a foundation on which to base analysisand research but must be applied wisely. Valuation is not simply a numerical analysis.The choice of model and the derivation of inputs require skill and judgment.When valuing a company or group of companies, the analyst wants to choose a valuationmodel that is appropriate for the information available to be used as inputs. Theavailable data will, in most instances, restrict the choice of model and influencethe way it is used. Complex models exist that may improve on the simple valuationmodels described in this reading; but before using those models and assuming thatcomplexity increases accuracy, the analyst would do well to consider the law of parsimony:A model should be kept as simple as possible in light of the available inputs. Valuationis a fallible discipline, and any method will result in an inaccurate forecast atsome time. The goal is to minimize the inaccuracy of the forecast.Among the points made in this reading are the following: An analyst estimating intrinsic value is implicitly questioning the markets estimate of value. If the estimated value exceeds the market price, the analyst infers the security is undervalued. If the estimated value equals the market price, the analyst infers the security is fairly valued. If the estimated value is less than the market price, the analyst infers the security is overvalued. Because of the uncertainties involved in valuation, an analyst may require that value estimates differ markedly from market price before concluding that a misvaluation exists. Analysts often use more than one valuation model because of concerns about the applicability of any particular model and the variability in estimates that result from changes in inputs. Three major categories of equity valuation models are present value, multiplier, and asset-based valuation models. Present value models estimate value as the present value of expected future benefits. Multiplier models estimate intrinsic value based on a multiple of some fundamental variable. Asset-based valuation models estimate value based on the estimated value of assets and liabilities. The choice of model will depend upon the availability of information to input into the model and the analysts confidence in both the information and the appropriateness of the model. Companies distribute cash to shareholders using dividend payments and share repurchases. Regular cash dividends are a key input to dividend valuation models. Key dates in dividend chronology are the declaration date, ex-dividend date, holder-of-record date, and payment date. In the dividend discount model, value is estimated as the present value of expected future dividends. In the free cash flow to equity model, value is estimated as the present value of expected future free cash flow to equity. The Gordon growth model, a simple DDM, estimates value as D 1/(r – g). The two stage dividend discount model estimates value as the sum of the present values of dividends over a short-term period of high growth and the present value of the terminal value at the end of the period of high growth. The terminal value is estimated using the Gordon growth model. The choice of dividend model is based upon the patterns assumed with respect to future dividends. Multiplier models typically use multiples of the form: P/ measure of fundamental variable or EV/ measure of fundamental variable. Multiples can be based upon fundamentals or comparables. Asset-based valuations models estimate value of equity as the value of the assets less the value of liabilities.",Equity Valuation: Concepts and Basic Tools,2024
"For those companies reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), IAS 12 [Income Taxes] covers accounting for a companys income taxes and the reporting of deferred taxes. For those companies reporting under United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), FASB ASC Topic 740 [Income Taxes] is the primary source for information on accounting for income taxes. Although IFRS and US GAAP follow similar conventions on many income tax issues, there are some key differences that will be discussed in the reading. Differences between how and when transactions are recognized for financial reporting purposes relative to tax reporting can give rise to differences in tax expense and related tax assets and liabilities. To reconcile these differences, companies that report under either IFRS or US GAAP create a provision on the balance sheet called deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities, depending on the nature of the situation. Deferred tax assets or liabilities usually arise when accounting standards and tax authorities recognize the timing of revenues and expenses at different times. Because timing differences such as these will eventually reverse over time, they are called temporary differences. Deferred tax assets represent taxes that have been recognized for tax reporting purposes (or often the carrying forward of losses from previous periods) but have not yet been recognized on the income statement prepared for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities represent tax expense that has appeared on the income statement for financial reporting purposes, but has not yet become payable under tax regulations. This reading provides a primer on the basics of income tax accounting and reporting. The reading is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the differences between taxable income and accounting profit. Section 3 explains the determination of tax base, which relates to the valuation of assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Section 4 discusses several types of timing differences between the recognition of taxable and accounting profit. Section 5 examines unused tax losses and tax credits. Section 6 describes the recognition and measurement of current and deferred tax. Section 7 discusses the disclosure and presentation of income tax information on companies financial statements and illustrates its practical implications for financial analysis.

Analyzing income tax expenses is often difficult for the analyst because there are many permanent and temporary timing differences between the accounting that is used for income tax reporting and the accounting that is used for financial reporting on company financial statements. The financial statements and notes to the financial statements of a company provide important information that the analyst needs to assess financial performance and to compare a companys financial performance with other companies. Key concepts in this reading are as follows: Differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and accounting purposes may result in taxable income differing from accounting profit. The discrepancy is a result of different treatments of certain income and expenditure items. The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes as an expense in the calculation of taxable income as the company expenses the tax basis of the asset. If the economic benefit will not be taxable, the tax base of the asset will be equal to the carrying amount of the asset. The tax base of a liability is the carrying amount of the liability less any amounts that will be deductible for tax purposes in the future. With respect to revenue received in advance, the tax base of such a liability is the carrying amount less any amount of the revenue that will not be taxable in the future. Temporary differences arise from recognition of differences in the tax base and carrying amount of assets and liabilities. The creation of a deferred tax asset or liability as a result of a temporary difference will only be allowed if the difference reverses itself at some future date and to the extent that it is expected that the balance sheet item will create future economic benefits for the company. Permanent differences result in a difference in tax and financial reporting of revenue (expenses) that will not be reversed at some future date. Because it will not be reversed at a future date, these differences do not constitute temporary differences and do not give rise to a deferred tax asset or liability. Current taxes payable or recoverable are based on the applicable tax rates on the balance sheet date of an entity; in contrast, deferred taxes should be measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply when the asset is realized or the liability settled. All unrecognized deferred tax assets and liabilities must be reassessed on the appropriate balance sheet date and measured against their probable future economic benefit. Deferred tax assets must be assessed for their prospective recoverability. If it is probable that they will not be recovered at all or partly, the carrying amount should be reduced. Under US GAAP, this is done through the use of a valuation allowance.",Income Taxes,2023
"Financial analysis tools can be useful in assessing a companys performance and trends in that performance. In essence, an analyst converts data into financial metrics that assist in decision making. Analysts seek to answer such questions as: How successfully has the company performed, relative to its own past performance and relative to its competitors? How is the company likely to perform in the future? Based on expectations about future performance, what is the value of this company or the securities it issues? A primary source of data is a companys annual report, including the financial statements and notes, and management commentary (operating and financial review or managements discussion and analysis). This reading focuses on data presented in financial reports prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP). However, financial reports do not contain all the information needed to perform effective financial analysis. Although financial statements do contain data about the past performance of a company (its income and cash flows) as well as its current financial condition (assets, liabilities, and owners equity), such statements do not necessarily provide all the information useful for analysis nor do they forecast future results. The financial analyst must be capable of using financial statements in conjunction with other information to make projections and reach valid conclusions. Accordingly, an analyst typically needs to supplement the information found in a companys financial reports with other information, including information on the economy, industry, comparable companies, and the company itself. This reading describes various techniques used to analyze a companys financial statements. Financial analysis of a company may be performed for a variety of reasons, such as valuing equity securities, assessing credit risk, conducting due diligence related to an acquisition, or assessing a subsidiarys performance. This reading will describe techniques common to any financial analysis and then discuss more specific aspects for the two most common categories: equity analysis and credit analysis. Equity analysis incorporates an owners perspective, either for valuation or performance evaluation. Credit analysis incorporates a creditors (such as a banker or bondholder) perspective. In either case, there is a need to gather and analyze information to make a decision (ownership or credit); the focus of analysis varies because of the differing interest of owners and creditors. Both equity and credit analyses assess the entitys ability to generate and grow earnings, and cash flow, as well as any associated risks. Equity analysis usually places a greater emphasis on growth, whereas credit analysis usually places a greater emphasis on risks. The difference in emphasis reflects the different fundamentals of these types of investments: The value of a companys equity generally increases as the companys earnings and cash flow increase, whereas the value of a companys debt has an upper limit. The balance of this reading is organized as follows: Section 2 recaps the framework for financial statements and the place of financial analysis techniques within the framework. Section 3 provides a description of analytical tools and techniques. Section 4 explains how to compute, analyze, and interpret common financial ratios. Sections 5 through 8 explain the use of ratios and other analytical data in equity analysis, credit analysis, segment analysis, and forecasting, respectively. A summary of the key points and practice problems in the CFA Institute multiple-choice format conclude the reading.","The member should be able to: describe tools and techniques used in financial analysis, including their uses and limitations; classify, calculate, and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, profitability, and valuation ratios; describe relationships among ratios and evaluate a company using ratio analysis; demonstrate the application of DuPont analysis of return on equity and calculate and interpret effects of changes in its components; calculate and interpret ratios used in equity analysis and credit analysis; explain the requirements for segment reporting and calculate and interpret segment ratios; describe how ratio analysis and other techniques can be used to model and forecast earnings.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V3R3_financial_analysis_techniques.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/financial-analysis-techniques,"Financial analysis techniques, including common-size financial statements and ratio analysis, are useful in summarizing financial reporting data and evaluating the performance and financial position of a company. The results of financial analysis techniques provide important inputs into security valuation. Key facets of financial analysis include the following: Common-size financial statements and financial ratios remove the effect of size, allowing comparisons of a company with peer companies (cross-sectional analysis) and comparison of a companys results over time (trend or time-series analysis). Activity ratios measure the efficiency of a companys operations, such as collection of receivables or management of inventory. Major activity ratios include inventory turnover, days of inventory on hand, receivables turnover, days of sales outstanding, payables turnover, number of days of payables, working capital turnover, fixed asset turnover, and total asset turnover. Liquidity ratios measure the ability of a company to meet short-term obligations. Major liquidity ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, and defensive interval ratio. Solvency ratios measure the ability of a company to meet long-term obligations. Major solvency ratios include debt ratios (including the debt-to-assets ratio, debt-to-capital ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and financial leverage ratio) and coverage ratios (including interest coverage and fixed charge coverage). Profitability ratios measure the ability of a company to generate profits from revenue and assets. Major profitability ratios include return on sales ratios (including gross profit margin, operating profit margin, pretax margin, and net profit margin) and return on investment ratios (including operating ROA, ROA, return on total capital, ROE, and return on common equity). Ratios can also be combined and evaluated as a group to better understand how they fit together and how efficiency and leverage are tied to profitability. ROE can be analyzed as the product of the net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. This decomposition is sometimes referred to as DuPont analysis. Valuation ratios express the relation between the market value of a company or its equity (for example, price per share) and some fundamental financial metric (for example, earnings per share). Ratio analysis is useful in the selection and valuation of debt and equity securities and is a part of the credit rating process. Ratios can also be computed for business segments to evaluate how units within a business are performing. The results of financial analysis provide valuable inputs into forecasts of future earnings and cash flow.",Financial Analysis Techniques,2024
"The purpose of this reading is to build an understanding of the importance of market structure. As different market structures result in different sets of choices facing a firms decision makers, an understanding of market structure is a powerful tool in analyzing issues such as a firms pricing of its products and, more broadly, its potential to increase profitability. In the long run, a firms profitability will be determined by the forces associated with the market structure within which it operates. In a highly competitive market, long-run profits will be driven down by the forces of competition. In less competitive markets, large profits are possible even in the long run; in the short run, any outcome is possible. Therefore, understanding the forces behind the market structure will aid the financial analyst in determining firms short- and long-term prospects. Section 2 introduces the analysis of market structures. The section addresses questions such as: What determines the degree of competition associated with each market structure? Given the degree of competition associated with each market structure, what decisions are left to the management team developing corporate strategy? How does a chosen pricing and output strategy evolve into specific decisions that affect the profitability of the firm? The answers to these questions are related to the forces of the market structure within which the firm operates. Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 analyze demand, supply, optimal price and output, and factors affecting long-run equilibrium for perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and pure monopoly, respectively. Section 7 reviews techniques for identifying the various forms of market structure. For example, there are accepted measures of market concentration that are used by regulators of financial institutions to judge whether or not a planned merger or acquisition will harm the competitive nature of regional banking markets. Financial analysts should be able to identify the type of market structure a firm is operating within. Each different structure implies a different long-run sustainability of profits. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading. ","The member should be able to: describe characteristics of perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and pure monopoly; explain relationships between price, marginal revenue, marginal cost, economic profit, and the elasticity of demand under each market structure; describe a firms supply function under each market structure; describe and determine the optimal price and output for firms under each market structure; explain factors affecting long-run equilibrium under each market structure; describe pricing strategy under each market structure; describe the use and limitations of concentration measures in identifying market structure; identify the type of market structure within which a firm operates.

We have analyzed the distinctions between the different structures that are important for understanding demand and supply relations, optimal price and output, and the factors affecting long-run profitability. We also provided guidelines for identifying market structure in practice. Among our conclusions are the following: Economic market structures can be grouped into four categories: perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly. The categories differ because of the following characteristics: The number of producers is many in perfect and monopolistic competition, few in oligopoly, and one in monopoly. The degree of product differentiation, the pricing power of the producer, the barriers to entry of new producers, and the level of non-price competition (e.g., advertising) are all low in perfect competition, moderate in monopolistic competition, high in oligopoly, and generally highest in monopoly. A financial analyst must understand the characteristics of market structures in order to better forecast a firms future profit stream. The optimal marginal revenue equals marginal cost. However, only in perfect competition does the marginal revenue equal price. In the remaining structures, price generally exceeds marginal revenue because a firm can sell more units only by reducing the per unit price. The quantity sold is highest in perfect competition. The price in perfect competition is usually lowest, but this depends on factors such as demand elasticity and increasing returns to scale (which may reduce the producers marginal cost). Monopolists, oligopolists, and producers in monopolistic competition attempt to differentiate their products so that they can charge higher prices. Typically, monopolists sell a smaller quantity at a higher price. Investors may benefit from being shareholders of monopolistic firms that have large margins and substantial positive cash flows. Competitive firms do not earn economic profit. There will be a market compensation for the rental of capital and of management services, but the lack of pricing power implies that there will be no extra margins. While in the short run firms in any market structure can have economic profits, the more competitive a market is and the lower the barriers to entry, the faster the extra profits will fade. In the long run, new entrants shrink margins and push the least efficient firms out of the market. Oligopoly is characterized by the importance of strategic behavior. Firms can change the price, quantity, quality, and advertisement of the product to gain an advantage over their competitors. Several types of equilibrium (e.g., Nash, Cournot, kinked demand curve) may occur that affect the likelihood of each of the incumbents (and potential entrants in the long run) having economic profits. Price wars may be started to force weaker competitors to abandon the market. Measuring market power is complicated. Ideally, econometric estimates of the elasticity of demand and supply should be computed. However, because of the lack of reliable data and the fact that elasticity changes over time (so that past data may not apply to the current situation), regulators and economists often use simpler measures. The concentration ratio is simple, but the HHI, with little more computation required, often produces a better figure for decision making. ",The Firm and Market Structures,2024
"Financial analysts often need to examine whether a variable is useful for explaining another variable. For example, the analyst may want to know whether earnings growth, or perhaps cash flow growth, helps explain the companys value in the marketplace. Regression analysis is a tool for examining this type of issue.","The member should be able to: describe a simple linear regression model and the roles of the dependent and independent variables in the model; describe the least squares criterion, how it is used to estimate regression coefficients, and their interpretation; explain the assumptions underlying the simple linear regression model, and describe how residuals and residual plots indicate if these assumptions may have been violated; calculate and interpret the coefficient of determination and the F-statistic in a simple linear regression; describe the use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) in regression analysis, interpret ANOVA results, and calculate and interpret the standard error of estimate in a simple linear regression; formulate a null and an alternative hypothesis about a population value of a regression coefficient, and determine whether the null hypothesis is rejected at a given level of significance; calculate and interpret the predicted value for the dependent variable, and a prediction interval for it, given an estimated linear regression model and a value for the independent variable; describe different functional forms of simple linear regressions.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V1R7-introduction-linear-regression.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/introduction-linear-regression,"The dependent variable in a linear regression is the variable whose variability the regression model tries to explain. The independent variable is the variable whose variation the researcher uses to explain the variation of the dependent variable. If there is one independent variable in a linear regression and there are n observations of the dependent and independent variables, the regression model is Yi = b0 + b1Xi + ei, i = 1, . . . , n, where Yi is the dependent variable, Xi is the independent variable, and ei is the error term. In this model, the coefficients and are the population intercept and slope, respectively. The intercept is the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable has a value of zero. The slope coefficient is the estimate of the population slope of the regression line and is the expected change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable. The assumptions of the classic simple linear regression model are as follows: Linearity: A linear relation exists between the dependent variable and the independent variable. Homoskedasticity: The variance of the error term is the same for all observations. Independence: The error term is uncorrelated across observations. Normality: The error term is normally distributed. The estimated parameters in a simple linear regression model minimize the sum of the squared errors. The coefficient of determination, or R2, measures the percentage of the total variation in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable. To test the fit of the simple linear regression, we can calculate an F-distributed test statistic and test the hypotheses H0: b1 = 0 versus Ha: b1 ¹ 0, with 1 and n - 2 degrees of freedom. The standard error of the estimate is an absolute measure of the fit of the model calculated as the square root of the mean square error. We can evaluate a regression model by testing whether the population value of a regression coefficient is equal to a particular hypothesized value. We do this by calculating a t-distributed test statistic that compares the estimated parameter with the hypothesized parameter, dividing this difference by the standard error of the coefficient. An indicator (or dummy) variable takes on only the values 0 or 1 and can be used as the independent variable in a simple linear regression. In such a model, the interpretation of the intercept is the predicted value of the dependent variable if the indicator variable is 0, and when the indicator variable is 1, the slope is the difference in the means if we grouped the observations by the indicator variable. We calculate a prediction interval for a regression coefficient using the estimated coefficient, the standard error of the estimated coefficient, and the critical value for the t-distributed test statistic based on the level of significance and the appropriate degrees of freedom, which are n - 2 for simple regression. We can make predictions for the dependent variable using an estimated linear regression by inserting the forecasted value of the independent variable into the estimated model. The standard error of the forecast is the product of the standard error of the estimate and a term that reflects the sample size of the regression, the variation of the independent variable, and the deviation between the forecasted value of the independent variable and the mean of the independent variable in the regression. The prediction interval for a particular forecasted value of the dependent variable is formed by using the forecasted value of the dependent variable and extending above and below this value a quantity that reflects the critical t-value corresponding to the degrees of freedom, the level of significance, and the standard error of the forecast. If the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is not linear, we can often transform one or both of these variables to convert this relation to a linear form, which then allows the use of simple linear regression.

"Understanding how industries and companies operate, together with an analysis of financial statements, provides a basis for forecasting company performance and allows analysts to determine the value of an investment in a company or its securities. Industry analysis is the analysis of a specific branch of manufacturing, service, or trade. Understanding the industry in which a company operates provides an essential framework for the analysis of the individual company—that is, company analysis. Equity analysis and credit analysis are often conducted by analysts who concentrate on one or several industries, which results in synergies and efficiencies in gathering and interpreting information. In this reading, we will address the following questions: What are the similarities and differences among industry classification systems? How does an analyst go about choosing a peer group of companies? What are the key factors to consider when analyzing an industry? What advantages are enjoyed by companies in strategically well-positioned industries? How should an analyst approach research and analysis of new industries? What are the factors that influence individual companies?","The member should be able to: explain uses of industry analysis and the relation of industry analysis to company analysis; compare methods by which companies can be grouped; explain the factors that affect the sensitivity of a company to the business cycle and the uses and limitations of industry and company descriptors such as growth, defensive, and cyclical; describe current industry classification systems, and identify how a company should be classified, given a description of its activities and the classification system; explain how a companys industry classification can be used to identify a potential peer group for equity valuation; describe the elements that need to be covered in a thorough industry analysis; describe the principles of strategic analysis of an industry; explain the effects of barriers to entry, industry concentration, industry capacity, and market share stability on pricing power and price competition; describe industry life-cycle models, classify an industry as to life-cycle stage, and describe limitations of the life-cycle concept in forecasting industry performance; describe macroeconomic, technological, demographic, governmental, social, and environmental influences on industry growth, profitability, and risk; compare characteristics of representative industries from the various economic sectors; describe the elements that should be covered in a thorough company analysis.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R8-introduction-industry-company-analysis.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/introduction-industry-company-analysis,"In this reading, we have provided an overview of industry analysis and illustratedapproaches that are widely used by analysts to examine an industry. Company analysis and industry analysis are closely interrelated. Company and industry analysis together can provide insight into sources of industry revenue growth and competitors market shares and thus the future of an individual companys top-line growth and bottom-line profitability. Industry analysis is useful for: understanding a companys business and business environment; identifying active equity investment opportunities; formulating an industry or sector rotation strategy; and portfolio performance attribution. The three main approaches to classifying companies are: products and/or services supplied; business-cycle sensitivities; and statistical similarities. Commercial industry classification systems include: Global Industry Classification Standard; Russell Global Sectors; and Industry Classification Benchmark. Governmental industry classification systems include: International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities; Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community; Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification; and North American Industry Classification System. A limitation of current classification systems is that the narrowest classification unit assigned to a company generally cannot be assumed to constitute its peer group for the purposes of detailed fundamental comparisons or valuation. A peer group is a group of companies engaged in similar business activities whose economics and valuation are influenced by closely related factors. Steps in constructing a preliminary list of peer companies: Examine commercial classification systems if available. These systems often provide a useful starting point for identifying companies operating in the same industry. Review the subject companys annual report for a discussion of the competitive environment. Companies frequently cite specific competitors. Review competitors annual reports to identify other potential comparables. Review industry trade publications to identify additional peer companies. Confirm that each comparable or peer company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from a similar business activity as the subject company. Not all industries are created equal. Some are highly competitive, with many companies struggling to earn returns in excess of their cost of capital, and other industries have attractive characteristics that enable a majority of industry participants to generate healthy profits. Differing competitive environments are determined by the structural attributes of the industry. For this important reason, industry analysis is a vital complement to company analysis. The analyst needs to understand the context in which a company operates to fully understand the opportunities and threats that a company faces. The framework for strategic analysis known as Porters five forces can provide a useful starting point. Porter maintains that the profitability of companies in an industry is determined by five forces: 1) The threat of new entrants, which in turn is determined by economies of scale, brand loyalty, absolute cost advantages, customer switching costs, and government regulation; 2) the bargaining power of suppliers, which is a function of the feasibility of product substitution, the concentration of the buyer and supplier groups, and switching costs and entry costs in each case; 3) the bargaining power of buyers, which is a function of switching costs among customers and the ability of customers to produce their own product; 4) the threat of substitutes; and 5) the intensity of rivalry among existing competitors, which in turn is a function of industry competitive structure, demand conditions, cost conditions, and the height of exit barriers. The concept of barriers to entry refers to the ease with which new competitors can challenge incumbents and can be an important factor in determining the competitive environment of an industry. If new competitors can easily enter the industry, the industry is likely to be highly competitive because incumbents that attempt to raise prices will be undercut by newcomers. As a result, industries with low barriers to entry tend to have low pricing power. Conversely, if incumbents are protected by barriers to entry, they may enjoy a more benign competitive environment that gives them greater pricing power over their customers because they do not have to worry about being undercut by upstarts. Industry concentration is often, although not always, a sign that an industry may have pricing power and rational competition. Industry fragmentation is a much stronger signal, however, that the industry is competitive and pricing power is limited. The effect of industry capacity on pricing is clear: Tight capacity gives participants more pricing power because demand for products or services exceeds supply; overcapacity leads to price cutting and a highly competitive environment as excess supply chases demand. The analyst should think about not only current capacity conditions but also future changes in capacity levels—how long it takes for supply and demand to come into balance and what effect that process has on industry pricing power and returns. Examining the market share stability of an industry over time is similar to thinking about barriers to entry and the frequency with which new players enter an industry. Stable market shares typically indicate less competitive industries, whereas unstable market shares often indicate highly competitive industries with limited pricing power. An industrys position in its life cycle often has a large impact on its competitive dynamics, so it is important to keep this positioning in mind when performing strategic analysis of an industry. Industries, like individual companies, tend to evolve over time and usually experience significant changes in the rate of growth and levels of profitability along the way. Just as an investment in an individual company requires careful monitoring, industry analysis is a continuous process that must be repeated over time to identify changes that may be occurring. A useful framework for analyzing the evolution of an industry is an industry life-cycle model, which identifies the sequential stages that an industry typically goes through. The five stages of an industry life cycle according to the Hill and Jones model are: embryonic; growth; shakeout; mature; and decline. Price competition and thinking like a customer are important factors that are often overlooked when analyzing an industry. Whatever factors most influence customer purchasing decisions are also likely to be the focus of competitive rivalry in the industry. Broadly, industries for which price is a large factor in customer purchase decisions tend to be more competitive than industries in which customers value other attributes more highly. External influences on industry growth, profitability, and risk include: technology; demographics; government; and social factors. Company analysis takes place after the analyst has gained an understanding of the companys external environment and includes answering questions about how the company will respond to the threats and opportunities presented by the external environment. This intended response is the individual companys competitive strategy. The analyst should seek to determine whether the strategy is primarily defensive or offensive in its nature and how the company intends to implement it. Porter identifies two chief competitive strategies: A low-cost strategy (cost leadership) is one in which companies strive to become the low-cost producers and to gain market share by offering their products and services at lower prices than their competition while still making a profit margin sufficient to generate a superior rate of return based on the higher revenues achieved. A product/service differentiation strategy is one in which companies attempt to establish themselves as the suppliers or producers of products and services that are unique either in quality, type, or means of distribution. To be successful, the companies price premiums must be above their costs of differentiation and the differentiation must be appealing to customers and sustainable over time. A checklist for company analysis includes a thorough investigation of: corporate profile; industry characteristics; demand for products/services; supply of products/services; pricing; and financial ratios. Spreadsheet modeling of financial statements to analyze and forecast revenues, operating and net income, and cash flows has become one of the most widely used tools in company analysis. Spreadsheet modeling can be used to quantify the effects of the changes in certain swing factors on the various financial statements. The analyst should be aware that the output of the model will depend significantly on the assumptions that are made.",Introduction to Industry and Company Analysis,2023
"Globally, the fixed-income market is a key source of financing for businesses and governments. In fact, the total market value outstanding of corporate and government bonds is significantly larger than that of equity securities. Similarly, the fixed-income market, which is also called the debt market or bond market, represents a significant investing opportunity for institutions as well as individuals. Pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds, among others, are major fixed-income investors. Retirees who desire a relatively stable income stream often hold fixed-income securities. Clearly, understanding how to value fixed-income securities is important to investors, issuers, and financial analysts. We focus on the valuation of traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bonds, although other debt securities, such as floating-rate notes and money market instruments, are also covered. We first describe and illustrate basic bond valuation, which includes pricing a bond using a market discount rate for each of the future cash flows and pricing a bond using a series of spot rates. Valuation using spot rates allows for each future cash flow to be discounted at a rate associated with its timing. This valuation methodology for future cash flows has applications well beyond the fixed-income market. Relationships among a bonds price, coupon rate, maturity, and market discount rate (yield-to-maturity) are also described and illustrated. We then turn our attention to how bond prices and yields are quoted and calculated in practice. When bonds are actively traded, investors can observe the price and calculate various yield measures. However, these yield measures differ by the type of bond. In practice, different measures are used for fixed-rate bonds, floating-rate notes, and money market instruments. We then discuss the maturity or term structure of interest rates, involving an analysis of yield curves, which illustrates the relationship between yields-to-maturity and times-to-maturity on bonds with otherwise similar characteristics. Lastly, we describe yield spreads, measures of how much additional yield over the benchmark security (usually a government bond) investors expect for bearing additional risk. ","The member should be able to: calculate a bonds price given a market discount rate; identify the relationships among a bonds price, coupon rate, maturity, and market discount rate (yield-to-maturity); define spot rates and calculate the price of a bond using spot rates; describe and calculate the flat price, accrued interest, and the full price of a bond; describe matrix pricing; calculate annual yield on a bond for varying compounding periods in a year; calculate and interpret yield measures for fixed-rate bonds and floating-rate notes; calculate and interpret yield measures for money market instruments; define and compare the spot curve, yield curve on coupon bonds, par curve, and forward curve; define forward rates and calculate spot rates from forward rates, forward rates from spot rates, and the price of a bond using forward rates; compare, calculate, and interpret yield spread measures.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R12-introduction-fixed-income-valuation.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/introduction-fixed-income-valuation,"We have covered the principles and techniques that are used in the valuation of fixed-rate bonds, as well as floating-rate notes and money market instruments. These building blocks are used extensively in fixed-income analysis. The following are the main points made: The market discount rate is the rate of return required by investors given the risk of the investment in the bond. A bond is priced at a premium above par value when the coupon rate is greater than the market discount rate. A bond is priced at a discount below par value when the coupon rate is less than the market discount rate. The amount of any premium or discount is the present value of the excess or deficiency in the coupon payments relative to the yield-to-maturity. The yield-to-maturity, the internal rate of return on the cash flows, is the implied market discount rate given the price of the bond. A bond price moves inversely with its market discount rate. The relationship between a bond price and its market discount rate is convex. The price of a lower-coupon bond is more volatile than the price of a higher-coupon bond, other things being equal. Generally, the price of a longer-term bond is more volatile than the price of a shorter-term bond, other things being equal. An exception to this phenomenon can occur on low-coupon (but not zero-coupon) bonds that are priced at a discount to par value. Assuming no default, premium and discount bond prices are pulled to par as maturity nears. A spot rate is the yield-to-maturity on a zero-coupon bond. A yield-to-maturity can be approximated as a weighted average of the underlying spot rates. Between coupon dates, the full (or invoice, or dirty) price of a bond is split between the flat (or quoted, or clean) price and the accrued interest. Flat prices are quoted to not misrepresent the daily increase in the full price as a result of interest accruals. Accrued interest is calculated as a proportional share of the next coupon payment using either the actual/actual or 30/360 methods to count days. Matrix pricing is used to value illiquid bonds by using prices and yields on comparable securities having the same or similar credit risk, coupon rate, and maturity. The periodicity of an annual interest rate is the number of periods in the year. A yield quoted on a semiannual bond basis is an annual rate for a periodicity of two. It is the yield per semiannual period times two. The general rule for periodicity conversions is that compounding more frequently at a lower annual rate corresponds to compounding less frequently at a higher annual rate. Street convention yields assume payments are made on scheduled dates, neglecting weekends and holidays.The current yield is the annual coupon payment divided by the flat price, thereby neglecting as a measure of the investors rate of return the time value of money, any accrued interest, and the gain from buying at a discount or the loss from buying at a premium. The simple yield is like the current yield but includes the straight-line amortization of the discount or premium. The yield-to-worst on a callable bond is the lowest of the yield-to-first-call, yield-to-second-call, and so on, calculated using the call price for the future value and the call date for the number of periods. The option-adjusted yield on a callable bond is the yield-to-maturity after adding the theoretical value of the call option to the price. A floating-rate note (floater, or FRN) maintains a more stable price than a fixed-rate note because interest payments adjust for changes in market interest rates. The quoted margin on a floater is typically the specified yield spread over or under the reference rate, which we refer to as the Market Reference Rate. The discount margin on a floater is the spread required by investors, and to which the quoted margin must be set, for the FRN to trade at par value on a rate reset date. Money market instruments, having one year or less time-to-maturity, are quoted on a discount rate or add-on rate basis. Money market discount rates understate the investors rate of return (and the borrowers cost of funds) because the interest income is divided by the face value or the total amount redeemed at maturity, and not by the amount of the investment. Money market instruments need to be converted to a common basis for analysis. A money market bond equivalent yield is an add-on rate for a 365-day year. The periodicity of a money market instrument is the number of days in the year divided by the number of days to maturity. Therefore, money market instruments with different times-to-maturity have annual rates for different periodicities. In theory, the maturity structure, or term structure, of interest rates is the relationship between yields-to-maturity and times-to-maturity on bonds having the same currency, credit risk, liquidity, tax status, and periodicity. A spot curve is a series of yields-to-maturity on zero-coupon bonds. A frequently used yield curve is a series of yields-to-maturity on coupon bonds. A par curve is a series of yields-to-maturity assuming the bonds are priced at par value. In a cash market, the delivery of the security and cash payment is made on a settlement date within a customary time period after the trade date—for example, T + 3. In a forward market, the delivery of the security and cash payment are made on a predetermined future date. A forward rate is the interest rate on a bond or money market instrument traded in a forward market. An implied forward rate (or forward yield) is the breakeven reinvestment rate linking the return on an investment in a shorter-term zero-coupon bond to the return on an investment in a longer-term zero-coupon bond. An implied forward curve can be calculated from the spot curve. Implied spot rates can be calculated as geometric averages of forward rates. A fixed-income bond can be valued using a market discount rate, a series of spot rates, or a series of forward rates. A bond yield-to-maturity can be separated into a benchmark and a spread. Changes in benchmark rates capture macroeconomic factors that affect all bonds in the market—inflation, economic growth, foreign exchange rates, and monetary and fiscal policy. Changes in spreads typically capture microeconomic factors that affect the particular bond—credit risk, liquidity, and tax effects. Benchmark rates are usually yields-to-maturity on government bonds or fixed rates on interest rate swaps. A G-spread is the spread over or under a government bond rate, and an I-spread is the spread over or under an interest rate swap rate. A G-spread or an I-spread can be based on a specific benchmark rate or on a rate interpolated from the benchmark yield curve. A Z-spread (zero-volatility spread) is based on the entire benchmark spot curve. It is the constant spread that is added to each spot rate such that the present value of the cash flows matches the price of the bond. An option-adjusted spread (OAS) on a callable bond is the Z-spread minus the theoretical value of the embedded call option. ",Introduction to Fixed-Income Valuation,2023
"Each day, we observe the high, low, and close of stock market indexes from around the world. Indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Nikkei 225 Stock Average are samples of stocks. Although the S&amp;P 500 and the Nikkei do not represent the populations of US or Japanese stocks, we view them as valid indicators of the whole populations behavior. As analysts, we are accustomed to using this sample information to assess how various markets from around the world are performing. Any statistics that we compute with sample information, however, are only estimates of the underlying population parameters. A sample, then, is a subset of the population—a subset studied to infer conclusions about the population itself. We introduce and discuss sampling—the process of obtaining a sample. In investments, we continually make use of the mean as a measure of central tendency of random variables, such as return and earnings per share. Even when the probability distribution of the random variable is unknown, we can make probability statements about the population mean using the central limit theorem. We discuss and illustrate this key result. Following that discussion, we turn to statistical estimation. Estimation seeks precise answers to the question What is this parameters value? The central limit theorem and estimation, the core of the body of methods presented in the sections that follow, may be applied in investment applications. We often interpret the results for the purpose of deciding what works and what does not work in investments. We will also discuss the interpretation of statistical results based on financial data and the possible pitfalls in this process.","The member should be able to: compare and contrast probability samples with non-probability samples and discuss applications of each to an investment problem; explain sampling error; compare and contrast simple random, stratified random, cluster, convenience, and judgmental sampling; explain the central limit theorem and its importance; calculate and interpret the standard error of the sample mean; identify and describe desirable properties of an estimator; contrast a point estimate and a confidence interval estimate of a population parameter; calculate and interpret a confidence interval for a population mean, given a normal distribution with 1) a known population variance, 2) an unknown population variance, or 3) an unknown population variance and a large sample size; describe the use of resampling (bootstrap, jackknife) to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic. describe the issues regarding selection of the appropriate sample size, data snooping bias, sample selection bias, survivorship bias, look-ahead bias, and time-period bias.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V1R5-sampling-estimation.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/sampling-estimation,"In this reading, we have presented basic concepts and results in sampling and estimation. We have also emphasized the challenges faced by analysts in appropriately using and interpreting financial data. As analysts, we should always use a critical eye when evaluating the results from any study. The quality of the sample is of the utmost importance: If the sample is biased, the conclusions drawn from the sample will be in error. To draw valid inferences from a sample, the sample should be random. In simple random sampling, each observation has an equal chance of being selected. In stratified random sampling, the population is divided into subpopulations, called strata or cells, based on one or more classification criteria; simple random samples are then drawn from each stratum. Stratified random sampling ensures that population subdivisions of interest are represented in the sample. Stratified random sampling also produces more-precise parameter estimates than simple random sampling. Convenience sampling selects an element from the population on the basis of whether or not it is accessible to a researcher or how easy it is to access. Because convenience sampling presents the advantage of collecting data quickly at a low cost, it is a suitable sampling plan for small-scale pilot studies. Judgmental sampling may yield skewed results because of the bias of researchers, but its advantages lie in the fact that in some circumstances, the specialty of researchers and their judgmental can lead them directly to the target population of interest within time constraints. The central limit theorem states that for large sample sizes, for any underlying distribution for a random variable, the sampling distribution of the sample mean for that variable will be approximately normal, with mean equal to the population mean for that random variable and variance equal to the population variance of the variable divided by sample size. Based on the central limit theorem, when the sample size is large, we can compute confidence intervals for the population mean based on the normal distribution regardless of the distribution of the underlying population. In general, a sample size of 30 or larger can be considered large. An estimator is a formula for estimating a parameter. An estimate is a particular value that we calculate from a sample by using an estimator. Because an estimator or statistic is a random variable, it is described by some probability distribution. We refer to the distribution of an estimator as its sampling distribution. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is called the standard error of the sample mean. The desirable properties of an estimator are unbiasedness (the expected value of the estimator equals the population parameter), efficiency (the estimator has the smallest variance), and consistency (the probability of accurate estimates increases as sample size increases). The two types of estimates of a parameter are point estimates and interval estimates. A point estimate is a single number that we use to estimate a parameter. An interval estimate is a range of values that brackets the population parameter with some probability. A confidence interval is an interval for which we can assert with a given probability 1 − a, called the degree of confidence, that it will contain the parameter it is intended to estimate. This measure is often referred to as the 100(1 − a)% confidence interval for the parameter. A 100(1 − a)% confidence interval for a parameter has the following structure: Point estimate ± Reliability factor × Standard error, where the reliability factor is a number based on the assumed distribution of the point estimate and the degree of confidence (1 − a) for the confidence interval and where standard error is the standard error of the sample statistic providing the point estimate. A 100(1 − a)% confidence interval for population mean µ when sampling from a normal distribution with known variance s2 is given by , where za/2 is the point of the standard normal distribution such that a/2 remains in the right tail. A random sample of size n is said to have n − 1 degrees of freedom for estimating the population variance, in the sense that there are only n − 1 independent deviations from the mean on which to base the estimate. A 100(1 − a)% confidence interval for the population mean µ when sampling from a normal distribution with unknown variance (a t-distribution confidence interval) is given by , where ta/2 is the point of the t-distribution such that a/2 remains in the right tail and s is the sample standard deviation. This confidence interval can also be used, because of the central limit theorem, when dealing with a large sample from a population with unknown variance that may not be normal. We may use the confidence interval as an alternative to the t-distribution confidence interval for the population mean when using a large sample from a population with unknown variance. The confidence interval based on the z-statistic is less conservative (narrower) than the corresponding confidence interval based on a t-distribution. Bootstrap and jackknife are simple but powerful methods for statistical inference, and they are particularly useful when no analytical formula is available. Bootstrap constructs the sampling distribution of an estimator by repeatedly drawing samples from the original sample to find standard error and confidence interval. Jackknife draws repeated samples while leaving out one observation at a time from the set, without replacing it. Three issues in the selection of sample size are the need for precision, the risk of sampling from more than one population, and the expenses of different sample sizes.• Data snooping bias comes from finding models by repeatedly searching through databases for patterns.• Sample selection bias occurs when data availability leads to certain assets being excluded from the analysis, we call the resulting problem• Survivorship bias is a subset of sample selection bias and occurs if companies are excluded from the analysis because they have gone out of business or because of reasons related to poor performance.• Self-selection bias reflects the ability of entities to decide whether or not they wish to report their attributes or results and be included in databases or samples. Implicit selection bias is one type of selection bias introduced through the presence of a threshold that filters out some unqualified members. A subset of selection bias is backfill bias, in which past data, not reported or used before, is backfilled into an existing database.• Look-ahead bias exists if the model uses data not available to market participants at the time the market participants act in the model.• Time-period bias is present if the period used makes the results period specific or if the period used includes a point of structural change.",Sampling and Estimation,2023
"Successful analysts must develop a solid understanding of the risk and return characteristics of fixed-income investments. Beyond the vast global market for public and private fixed-rate bonds, many financial assets and liabilities with known future cash flows you will encounter throughout your career are evaluated using similar principles. This analysis starts with the yield-to-maturity, or internal rate of return on future cash flows, introduced in the fixed-income valuation reading. Fixed-rate bond returns are affected by many factors, the most important of which is the full receipt of all interest and principal payments on scheduled dates. Assuming no default, return is also affected by interest rate changes that affect coupon reinvestment and the bond price if it is sold prior to maturity. Price change measures may be derived from the mathematical relationship used to calculate a bonds price. Specifically, duration estimates the price change for a given change in interest rates, and convexity improves on the duration estimate by considering that the price and yield-to-maturity relationship of a fixed-rate bond is non-linear. Sources of return on a fixed-rate bond investment include the receipt and reinvestment of coupon payments and either the redemption of principal if the bond is held to maturity or capital gains (or losses) if the bond is sold earlier. Fixed-income investors holding the same bond may have different interest rate risk exposures if their investment horizons differ. We introduce bond duration and convexity, showing how these statistics are calculated and used as interest rate risk measures. Although procedures and formulas exist to calculate duration and convexity, these statistics can be approximated using basic bond-pricing techniques and a financial calculator. Commonly used versions of the statistics are covered, including Macaulay, modified, effective, and key rate durations, and we distinguish between risk measures based on changes in the bonds yield-to-maturity (i.e., yield duration and convexity) and on benchmark yield curve changes (i.e., curve duration and convexity). We then return to the investment time horizon. When an investor has a short-term horizon, duration and convexity are used to estimate the change in the bond price. Note that yield volatility matters, because bonds with varying times-to-maturity have different degrees of yield volatility. When an investor has a long-term horizon, the interaction between coupon reinvestment risk and market price risk matters. The relationship among interest rate risk, bond duration, and the investment horizon is explored. Finally, we discuss how duration and convexity may be extended to credit and liquidity risks and highlight how these factors can affect a bonds return and risk. In addition, we highlight the use of statistical methods and historical data to establish empirical as opposed to analytical duration estimates.

The focus is on the widely used measures of interest rate risk—duration and convexity. These statistics are used extensively in fixed-income analysis. The following are the main points made in the reading: The three sources of return on a fixed-rate bond purchased at par value are: (1) receipt of the promised coupon and principal payments on the scheduled dates, (2) reinvestment of coupon payments, and (3) potential capital gains, as well as losses, on the sale of the bond prior to maturity. For a bond purchased at a discount or premium, the rate of return also includes the effect of the price being pulled to par as maturity nears, assuming no default. The total return is the future value of reinvested coupon interest payments and the sale price (or redemption of principal if the bond is held to maturity).The horizon yield (or holding period rate of return) is the internal rate of return between the total return and purchase price of the bond. Coupon reinvestment risk increases with a higher coupon rate and a longer reinvestment time period. Capital gains and losses are measured from the carrying value of the bond and not from the purchase price. The carrying value includes the amortization of the discount or premium if the bond is purchased at a price below or above par value. The carrying value is any point on the constant-yield price trajectory. Interest income on a bond is the return associated with the passage of time. Capital gains and losses are the returns associated with a change in the value of a bond as indicated by a change in the yield-to-maturity. The two types of interest rate risk on a fixed-rate bond are coupon reinvestment risk and market price risk. These risks offset each other to a certain extent. An investor gains from higher rates on reinvested coupons but loses if the bond is sold at a capital loss because the price is below the constant-yield price trajectory. An investor loses from lower rates on reinvested coupon but gains if the bond is sold at a capital gain because the price is above the constant-yield price trajectory. Market price risk dominates coupon reinvestment risk when the investor has a short-term horizon (relative to the time-to-maturity on the bond). Coupon reinvestment risk dominates market price risk when the investor has a long-term horizon (relative to the time-to-maturity)—for instance, a buy-and-hold investor. Bond duration, in general, measures the sensitivity of the full price (including accrued interest) to a change in interest rates. Yield duration statistics measuring the sensitivity of a bonds full price to the bonds own yield-to-maturity include the Macaulay duration, modified duration, money duration, and price value of a basis point. Curve duration statistics measuring the sensitivity of a bonds full price to the benchmark yield curve are usually called effective durations. Macaulay duration is the weighted average of the time to receipt of coupon interest and principal payments, in which the weights are the shares of the full price corresponding to each payment. This statistic is annualized by dividing by the periodicity (number of coupon payments or compounding periods in a year). Modified duration provides a linear estimate of the percentage price change for a bond given a change in its yield-to-maturity. Approximate modified duration approaches modified duration as the change in the yield-to-maturity approaches zero. Effective duration is very similar to approximate modified duration. The difference is that approximate modified duration is a yield duration statistic that measures interest rate risk in terms of a change in the bonds own yield-to-maturity, whereas effective duration is a curve duration statistic that measures interest rate risk assuming a parallel shift in the benchmark yield curve. Key rate duration is a measure of a bonds sensitivity to a change in the benchmark yield curve at specific maturity segments. Key rate durations can be used to measure a bonds sensitivity to changes in the shape of the yield curve. Bonds with an embedded option do not have a meaningful internal rate of return because future cash flows are contingent on interest rates. Therefore, effective duration is the appropriate interest rate risk measure, not modified duration. The effective duration of a traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bond is its sensitivity to the benchmark yield curve, which can differ from its sensitivity to its own yield-to-maturity. Therefore, modified duration and effective duration on a traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bond are not necessarily equal. During a coupon period, Macaulay and modified durations decline smoothly in a saw-tooth pattern, assuming the yield-to-maturity is constant. When the coupon payment is made, the durations jump upward. Macaulay and modified durations are inversely related to the coupon rate and the yield-to-maturity. Time-to-maturity and Macaulay and modified durations are usually positively related. They are always positively related on bonds priced at par or at a premium above par value. They are usually positively related on bonds priced at a discount below par value. The exception is on long-term, low-coupon bonds, on which it is possible to have a lower duration than on an otherwise comparable shorter-term bond. The presence of an embedded call option reduces a bonds effective duration compared with that of an otherwise comparable non-callable bond. The reduction in the effective duration is greater when interest rates are low and the issuer is more likely to exercise the call option. The presence of an embedded put option reduces a bonds effective duration compared with that of an otherwise comparable non-putable bond. The reduction in the effective duration is greater when interest rates are high and the investor is more likely to exercise the put option. The duration of a bond portfolio can be calculated in two ways: (1) the weighted average of the time to receipt of aggregate cash flows and (2) the weighted average of the durations of individual bonds that compose the portfolio. The first method to calculate portfolio duration is based on the cash flow yield, which is the internal rate of return on the aggregate cash flows. It cannot be used for bonds with embedded options or for floating-rate notes. The second method is simpler to use and quite accurate when the yield curve is relatively flat. Its main limitation is that it assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve in that the yields on all bonds in the portfolio change by the same amount. Money duration is a measure of the price change in terms of units of the currency in which the bond is denominated. The price value of a basis point (PVBP) is an estimate of the change in the full price of a bond given a 1 bp change in the yield-to-maturity. Modified duration is the primary, or first-order, effect on a bonds percentage price change given a change in the yield-to-maturity. Convexity is the secondary, or second-order, effect. It indicates the change in the modified duration as the yield-to-maturity changes. Money convexity is convexity times the full price of the bond. Combined with money duration, money convexity estimates the change in the full price of a bond in units of currency given a change in the yield-to-maturity. Convexity is a positive attribute for a bond. Other things being equal, a more convex bond appreciates in price more than a less convex bond when yields fall and depreciates less when yields rise. Effective convexity is the second-order effect on a bond price given a change in the benchmark yield curve. It is similar to approximate convexity. The difference is that approximate convexity is based on a yield-to-maturity change and effective convexity is based on a benchmark yield curve change. Callable bonds have negative effective convexity when interest rates are low. The increase in price when the benchmark yield is reduced is less in absolute value than the decrease in price when the benchmark yield is raised. The change in a bond price is the product of: (1) the impact per basis-point change in the yield-to-maturity and (2) the number of basis points in the yield change. The first factor is estimated by duration and convexity. The second factor depends on yield volatility. The investment horizon is essential in measuring the interest rate risk on a fixed-rate bond. For a particular assumption about yield volatility, the Macaulay duration indicates the investment horizon for which coupon reinvestment risk and market price risk offset each other. The assumption is a one-time parallel shift to the yield curve in which the yield-to-maturity and coupon reinvestment rates change by the same amount in the same direction. When the investment horizon is greater than the Macaulay duration of the bond, coupon reinvestment risk dominates price risk. The investors risk is to lower interest rates. The duration gap is negative. When the investment horizon is equal to the Macaulay duration of the bond, coupon reinvestment risk offsets price risk. The duration gap is zero. When the investment horizon is less than the Macaulay duration of the bond, price risk dominates coupon reinvestment risk. The investors risk is to higher interest rates. The duration gap is positive. Credit risk involves the probability of default and degree of recovery if default occurs, whereas liquidity risk refers to the transaction costs associated with selling a bond. For a traditional (option-free) fixed-rate bond, the same duration and convexity statistics apply if a change occurs in the benchmark yield or a change occurs in the spread. The change in the spread can result from a change in credit risk or liquidity risk. In practice, there often is interaction between changes in benchmark yields and in the spread over the benchmark. Empirical duration uses statistical methods and historical bond prices to derive the price–yield relationship for specific bonds or bond portfolios.",Understanding Fixed-Income Risk and Return,2023

"A company grows by making investments that are expected to increase revenues and profits. It acquires the capital or funds necessary to make such investments by borrowing (i.e., using debt financing) or by using funds from the owners (i.e., equity financing). By applying this capital to investments with long-term benefits, the company is producing value today. How much value? The answer depends not only on the investments expected future cash flows but also on the cost of the funds. Borrowing is not costless, nor is using owners funds. The cost of this capital is an important ingredient in both investment decision making by the companys management and the valuation of the company by investors. If a company invests in projects that produce a return in excess of the cost of capital, the company has created value; in contrast, if the company invests in projects whose returns are less than the cost of capital, the company has destroyed value. Therefore, the estimation of the cost of capital is a central issue in corporate financial management and for an analyst seeking to evaluate a companys investment program and its competitive position. Cost of capital estimation is a challenging task. As we have already implied, the cost of capital is not observable but, rather, must be estimated. Arriving at a cost of capital estimate requires a multitude of assumptions and estimates. Another challenge is that the cost of capital that is appropriately applied to a specific investment depends on the characteristics of that investment: The riskier the investments cash flows, the greater its cost of capital. In reality, a company must estimate project-specific costs of capital. What is often done, however, is to estimate the cost of capital for the company as a whole and then adjust this overall corporate cost of capital upward or downward to reflect the risk of the contemplated project relative to the companys average project. This reading is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the cost of capital and its basic computation. Section 3 presents a selection of methods for estimating the costs of the various sources of capital: debt, preferred stock, and common equity. For the latter, two approaches for estimating the equity risk premium are mentioned. Section 4 discusses beta estimation, a key input in using the CAPM to calculate the cost of equity, and Section 5 examines the correct treatment of flotation, or capital issuance, costs. Section 6 highlights methods used by corporations, and a summary concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: calculate and interpret the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of a company; describe how taxes affect the cost of capital from different capital sources; calculate and interpret the cost of debt capital using the yield-to-maturity approach and the debt-rating approach; calculate and interpret the cost of noncallable, nonconvertible preferred stock; calculate and interpret the cost of equity capital using the capital asset pricing model approach and the bond yield plus risk premium approach; explain and demonstrate beta estimation for public companies, thinly traded public companies, and nonpublic companies; explain and demonstrate the correct treatment of flotation costs.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R1-cost-capital-foundational-topics.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/cost-capital,"In this reading, we provided an overview of the techniques used to calculate the cost of capital for companies and projects. We examined the weighted average cost of capital, discussing the methods commonly used to estimate the component costs of capital and the weights applied to these components. The weighted average cost of capital is a weighted average of the after-tax marginal costs of each source of capital: WACC = wdrd(1 – t) + wprp + were The before-tax cost of debt is generally estimated by either the yield-to-maturity method or the bond rating method. The yield-to-maturity method of estimating the before-tax cost of debt uses the familiar bond valuation equation. Assuming semi-annual coupon payments, the equation isP0=PMT1(1+rd2)+…+PMTn(1+rd2)n+FV(1+rd2)n=(∑t=1nPMTt(1+rd2)t)+FV(1+rd2)nWe solve for the six-month yield (rd/2) and then annualize it to arrive at the before-tax cost of debt, rd. Because interest payments are generally tax deductible, the after-tax cost is the true, effective cost of debt to the company. If a yield to maturity or bond rating is not available, such as in the case of a private company without rated debt or a project, the estimate of the cost of debt becomes more challenging. The cost of preferred stock is the preferred stock dividend divided by the current preferred stock price: rp=DpPp The cost of equity is the rate of return required by a companys common stockholders. We estimate this cost using the CAPM (or its variants). The CAPM is the approach most commonly used to calculate the cost of equity. The three components needed to calculate the cost of equity are the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium, and beta: E(Ri)=RF+βi[E(RM)−RF] In estimating the cost of equity, an alternative to the CAPM is the bond yield plus risk premium approach. In this approach, we estimate the before-tax cost of debt and add a risk premium that reflects the additional risk associated with the companys equity. When estimating the cost of equity capital using the CAPM when we do not have publicly traded equity, we may be able to use the pure-play method in which we estimate the unlevered beta for a company with similar business risk, βU, βU,comparable=βL,comparable[1+((1−tcomparable)DcomparableEcomparable)] and then lever this beta to reflect the financial risk of the project or company: βL,project=βU,comparable[1+((1−tproject)DprojectEproject)] Then, we lever this beta to reflect the financial risk of the project or company: Flotation costs are costs incurred in the process of raising additional capital. The preferred method of including these costs in the analysis is as an initial cash flow in the valuation analysis. Survey evidence tells us that the CAPM method is the most popular method used by companies in estimating the cost of equity. The CAPM method is more popular with larger, publicly traded companies, which is understandable considering the additional analyses and assumptions required in estimating systematic risk for a private company or project.

"Investment decisions are made in a risky environment. The tools that allow us to make decisions with consistency and logic in this setting are based on probability concepts. This reading presents the essential probability tools needed to frame and address many real-world problems involving risk. These tools apply to a variety of issues, such as predicting investment manager performance, forecasting financial variables, and pricing bonds so that they fairly compensate bondholders for default risk. Our focus is practical. We explore the concepts that are most important to investment research and practice. Among these are independence, as it relates to the predictability of returns and financial variables; expectation, as analysts continually look to the future in their analyses and decisions; and variability, variance or dispersion around expectation, as a risk concept important in investments.

A random variable is a quantity whose outcome is uncertain. Probability is a number between 0 and 1 that describes the chance that a stated event will occur. An event is a specified set of outcomes of a random variable. Mutually exclusive events can occur only one at a time. Exhaustive events cover or contain all possible outcomes. The two defining properties of a probability are, first, that 0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1 (where P(E) denotes the probability of an event E), and second, that the sum of the probabilities of any set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events equals 1. A probability estimated from data as a relative frequency of occurrence is an empirical probability. A probability drawing on personal or subjective judgment is a subjective probability. A probability obtained based on logical analysis is an a priori probability. A probability of an event E, P(E), can be stated as odds for E = P(E)/[1 − P(E)] or odds against E = [1 − P(E)]/P(E). Probabilities that are inconsistent create profit opportunities, according to the Dutch Book Theorem. A probability of an event not conditioned on another event is an unconditional probability. The unconditional probability of an event A is denoted P(A). Unconditional probabilities are also called marginal probabilities. A probability of an event given (conditioned on) another event is a conditional probability. The probability of an event A given an event B is denoted P(A | B), and P(A | B) = P(AB)/P(B), P(B) ≠ 0. The probability of both A and B occurring is the joint probability of A and B, denoted P(AB). The multiplication rule for probabilities is P(AB) = P(A | B)P(B). The probability that A or B occurs, or both occur, is denoted by P(A or B). The addition rule for probabilities is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(AB). When events are independent, the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other event. Otherwise, the events are dependent. The multiplication rule for independent events states that if A and B are independent events, P(AB) = P(A)P(B). The rule generalizes in similar fashion to more than two events. According to the total probability rule, if S 1, S 2, …, Sn are mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios or events, then P(A) = P(A | S 1)P(S 1) + P(A | S 2)P(S 2) + … + P(A | Sn )P(Sn ). The expected value of a random variable is a probability-weighted average of the possible outcomes of the random variable. For a random variable X, the expected value of X is denoted E(X). The total probability rule for expected value states that E(X) = E(X | S 1)P(S 1) + E(X | S 2)P(S 2) + … + E(X | Sn )P(Sn ), where S 1, S 2, …, Sn are mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios or events. The variance of a random variable is the expected value (the probability-weighted average) of squared deviations from the random variables expected value E(X): σ2(X) = E{[X − E(X)]2}, where σ2(X) stands for the variance of X. Variance is a measure of dispersion about the mean. Increasing variance indicates increasing dispersion. Variance is measured in squared units of the original variable. Standard deviation is the positive square root of variance. Standard deviation measures dispersion (as does variance), but it is measured in the same units as the variable. Covariance is a measure of the co-movement between random variables. The covariance between two random variables Ri and Rj in a forward-looking sense is the expected value of the cross-product of the deviations of the two random variables from their respective means: Cov(Ri ,Rj ) = E{[Ri − E(Ri )][Rj − E(Rj )]}. The covariance of a random variable with itself is its own variance. The historical or sample covariance between two random variables Ri and Rj based on a sample of past data of size n is the average value of the product of the deviations of observations on two random variables from their sample means: Cov ( R i , R j ) = ∑ i = 1 n ( R i , t − R ¯ i ) ( R j , t − R ¯ j ) / ( n − 1 ) Correlation is a number between −1 and +1 that measures the co-movement (linear association) between two random variables: ρ(Ri ,Rj ) = Cov(Ri ,Rj )/[σ(Ri ) σ(Rj )]. If two variables have a very strong linear relation, then the absolute value of their correlation will be close to 1. If two variables have a weak linear relation, then the absolute value of their correlation will be close to 0. If the correlation coefficient is positive, the two variables are directly related; if the correlation coefficient is negative, the two variables are inversely related. To calculate the variance of return on a portfolio of n assets, the inputs needed are the n expected returns on the individual assets, n variances of return on the individual assets, and n(n − 1)/2 distinct covariances. Portfolio variance of return is σ 2 ( R p ) = ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 n w i w j Cov ( R i , R j ) . The calculation of covariance in a forward-looking sense requires the specification of a joint probability function, which gives the probability of joint occurrences of values of the two random variables. When two random variables are independent, the joint probability function is the product of the individual probability functions of the random variables. Bayes formula is a method for updating probabilities based on new information. Bayes formula is expressed as follows: Updated probability of event given the new information = [(Probability of the new information given event)/(Unconditional probability of the new information)] × Prior probability of event. The multiplication rule of counting says, for example, that if the first step in a process can be done in 10 ways, the second step, given the first, can be done in 5 ways, and the third step, given the first two, can be done in 7 ways, then the steps can be carried out in (10)(5)(7) = 350 ways. The number of ways to assign every member of a group of size n to n slots is n! = n (n − 1) (n − 2)(n − 3) … 1. (By convention, 0! = 1.) The number of ways that n objects can be labeled with k different labels, with n 1 of the first type, n 2 of the second type, and so on, with n 1 + n 2 + … + nk = n, is given by n!/(n 1!n 2! … nk !). This expression is the multinomial formula. A special case of the multinomial formula is the combination formula. The number of ways to choose r objects from a total of n objects, when the order in which the r objects are listed does not matter, is n C r = ( n r ) = n ! ( n − r ) ! r ! The number of ways to choose r objects from a total of n objects, when the order in which the r objects are listed does matter, is n P r = n ! ( n − r ) ! This expression is the permutation formula.",Probability Concepts,2023
"Global fixed-income markets represent the largest subset of financial markets in terms of number of issuances and market capitalization, they bring borrowers and lenders together to allocate capital globally to its most efficient uses. Fixed-income markets include not only publicly traded securities, such as commercial paper, notes, and bonds, but also non-publicly traded loans. Although they usually attract less attention than equity markets, fixed-income markets are more than three times the size of global equity markets. The Institute of International Finance reports that the size of the global debt market surpassed USD 253 trillion in the third quarter of 2019, representing a 322% global debt-to-GDP ratio (1 Institute of International Finance Global Debt Monitor, January 13, 2020). Debt investors and issuers need to understand how fixed-income markets are structured and how they operate. Debt issuers have financing needs that must be met. For example, a government may need to finance an infrastructure project, a new hospital, or a new school. A start-up technology company may require funds beyond its initial seed funding from investors to expand its business and achieve scale. Financial institutions also have funding needs, and they are among the largest issuers of fixed-income securities. Among the questions this reading addresses are the following: What are the key bond market sectors? How are bonds sold in primary markets and traded in secondary markets? What types of bonds are issued by governments, government-related entities, financial companies, and non-financial companies? What additional sources of funds are available to banks? We first present an overview of global fixed-income markets and how these markets are classified. We identify the major issuers of and investors in fixed-income securities, present fixed-income indexes, discuss how fixed-income securities are issued in primary markets, and explore how these securities are then traded in secondary markets. We also examine different bond market sectors and discuss additional short-term funding alternatives available to banks.","The member should be able to: describe classifications of global fixed-income markets; describe the use of interbank offered rates as reference rates in floating-rate debt; describe mechanisms available for issuing bonds in primary markets; describe secondary markets for bonds; describe securities issued by sovereign governments; describe securities issued by non-sovereign governments, quasi-government entities, and supranational agencies; describe types of debt issued by corporations; describe structured financial instruments; describe short-term funding alternatives available to banks; describe repurchase agreements (repos) and the risks associated with them.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R11-fixed-income-markets-issuance-trading-funding.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/fixed-income-markets-issuance-trading-funding,"Debt financing is an important source of funds for households, governments, government-related entities, financial institutions, and non-financial companies. Well-functioning fixed-income markets help ensure that capital is allocated efficiently to its highest and best use globally. Important points include the following: The most widely used ways of classifying fixed-income markets include the type of issuer; the bonds credit quality, maturity, currency denomination, and type of coupon; and where the bonds are issued and traded. Based on the type of issuer, the four major bond market sectors are the household, non-financial corporate, government, and financial institution sectors. Investors distinguish between investment-grade and high-yield bond markets based on the issuers credit quality. Money markets are where securities with original maturities ranging from overnight to one year are issued and traded, whereas capital markets are where securities with original maturities longer than one year are issued and traded. The majority of bonds are denominated in either euros or US dollars. Investors distinguish between bonds that pay a fixed rate versus a floating rate of interest. The coupon rate of floating-rate bonds is often expressed as a reference rate plus a spread. Interbank offered rates, such as Libor, historically have been the most commonly used reference rates for floating-rate debt and other financial instruments but are being phased out to be replaced by alternative reference rates. Based on where the bonds are issued and traded, investors distinguish between domestic and international bond markets. The latter includes the Eurobond market, which falls outside the jurisdiction of any single country and is characterized by less reporting, regulatory, and tax constraints. Investors also distinguish between developed and emerging bond markets. Investors and investment managers use fixed-income indexes to describe bond markets or sectors and to evaluate performance of investments and investment managers. The largest investors in bonds include central banks; institutional investors, such as pension funds, hedge funds, charitable foundations and endowments, insurance companies, mutual funds and ETFs, and banks; and retail investors, typically by means of indirect investments. Primary markets are markets in which issuers first sell bonds to investors to raise capital. Secondary markets are markets in which existing bonds are subsequently traded among investors. There are two mechanisms for issuing a bond in primary markets: a public offering, in which any member of the public may buy the bonds, or a private placement, in which only an investor or small group of investors may buy the bonds either directly from the issuer or through an investment bank. Public bond issuing mechanisms include underwritten offerings, best-efforts offerings, shelf registrations, and auctions. When an investment bank underwrites a bond issue, it buys the entire issue and takes the risk of reselling it to investors or dealers. In contrast, in a best-efforts offering, the investment bank serves only as a broker and sells the bond issue only if it is able to do so. Underwritten and best-efforts offerings are frequently used in the issuance of corporate bonds. The underwriting process typically includes six phases: the determination of the funding needs, the selection of the underwriter, the structuring and announcement of the bond offering, pricing, issuance, and closing. A shelf registration is a method for issuing securities in which the issuer files a single document with regulators that describes and allows for a range of future issuances. An auction is a public offering method that involves bidding and is helpful both in providing price discovery and in allocating securities. Auctions are frequently used in the issuance of sovereign bonds. Most bonds are traded in OTC markets, and institutional investors are the major buyers and sellers of bonds in secondary markets. Sovereign bonds are issued by national governments primarily for fiscal reasons. These bonds take different names and forms depending on where they are issued, their maturities, and their coupon types. Most sovereign bonds are fixed-rate bonds, although some national governments also issue floating-rate bonds and inflation-linked bonds. Local governments, quasi-government entities, and supranational agencies issue bonds, which are named non-sovereign, quasi-government, and supranational bonds, respectively. Companies raise debt in the form of bilateral loans, syndicated loans, commercial paper, notes, and bonds. Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured security that companies use as a source of short-term and bridge financing. Investors in commercial paper are exposed to credit risk, although defaults are rare. Many issuers roll over their commercial paper on a regular basis. Corporate bonds and notes take different forms depending on the maturities, coupon payment, and principal repayment structures. Important considerations also include collateral backing and contingency provisions. Medium-term notes are securities that are offered continuously to investors by an agent of the issuer. They can have short-term or long-term maturities. The structured finance sector includes asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and other structured financial instruments. All of these seemingly disparate financial instruments share the common attribute of repackaging risks. Many structured financial instruments are customized instruments that often combine a bond and at least one derivative. The redemption and often the coupons of these structured financial instruments are linked via a formula to the performance of the underlying asset(s). Thus, the bonds payment features are replaced with non-traditional payoffs derived not from the issuers cash flows but from the performance of the underlying asset(s). Capital protected, yield enhancement, participation and leveraged instruments are typical examples of structured financial instruments. Financial institutions have access to additional sources of funds, such as retail deposits, central bank funds, interbank funds, large-denomination negotiable certificates of deposit, and repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is similar to a collateralized loan. It involves the sale of a security (the collateral) with a simultaneous agreement by the seller (the borrower) to buy back the same security from the purchaser (the lender) at an agreed-on price in the future. Repurchase agreements are a common source of funding for dealer firms and are also used to borrow securities to implement short positions.

"Measured by daily turnover, the foreign exchange (FX) market—the market in which currencies are traded against each other—is by far the worlds largest market. Current estimates put daily turnover at approximately USD5.1 trillion for 2016. This is about 10 to 15 times larger than daily turnover in global fixed-income markets and about 50 times larger than global turnover in equities. The FX market is also a truly global market that operates 24 hours a day, each business day. It involves market participants from every time zone connected through electronic communications networks that link players as large as multibillion-dollar investment funds and as small as individuals trading for their own account—all brought together in real time. International trade would be impossible without the trade in currencies that facilitates it, and so too would cross-border capital flows that connect all financial markets globally through the FX market. These factors make foreign exchange a key market for investors and market participants to understand. The world economy is increasingly transnational in nature, with both production processes and trade flows often determined more by global factors than by domestic considerations. Likewise, investment portfolio performance increasingly reflects global determinants because pricing in financial markets responds to the array of investment opportunities available worldwide, not just locally. All of these factors funnel through, and are reflected in, the foreign exchange market. As investors shed their home bias and invest in foreign markets, the exchange rate—the price at which foreign-currency-denominated investments are valued in terms of the domestic currency—becomes an increasingly important determinant of portfolio performance. Even investors adhering to a purely domestic portfolio mandate are increasingly affected by what happens in the foreign exchange market. Given the globalization of the world economy, most large companies depend heavily on their foreign operations (for example, by some estimates about 30 percent of S&amp;P 500 Index earnings are from outside the United States). Almost all companies are exposed to some degree of foreign competition, and the pricing for domestic assets—equities, bonds, real estate, and others—will also depend on demand from foreign investors. All of these various influences on investment performance reflect developments in the foreign exchange market. This reading introduces the foreign exchange market, providing the basic concepts and terminology necessary to understand exchange rates as well as some of the basics of exchange rate economics. The reading is divided up as follows. Section 2 describes the organization of the foreign exchange market and discusses the major players—who they are, how they conduct their business, and how they respond to exchange rate changes. Section 3 takes up the mechanics of exchange rates: definitions, quotes, and calculations. This section shows that the reader has to pay close attention to conventions used in various foreign exchange markets around the world because they can vary widely. Sometimes exchange rates are quoted in the number of domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency, and sometimes they are quoted in the opposite way. The exact notation used to represent exchange rates can vary widely as well, and occasionally the same exchange rate notation will be used by different sources to mean completely different things. The notation used here may not be the same as that encountered elsewhere. Therefore, the focus should be on understanding the underlying concepts rather than relying on rote memorization of formulas. We also show how to calculate cross-exchange rates and how to compute the forward exchange rate given either the forward points or the percentage forward premium or discount. In Section 4, we discuss alternative exchange rate regimes operating throughout the world. Finally, in Section 5, we discuss how exchange rates affect a countrys international trade (exports and imports) and capital flows. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading. ","The member should be able to: define an exchange rate and distinguish between nominal and real exchange rates and spot and forward exchange rates; describe functions of and participants in the foreign exchange market; calculate and interpret the percentage change in a currency relative to another currency; calculate and interpret currency cross-rates; convert forward quotations expressed on a points basis or in percentage terms into an outright forward quotation; explain the arbitrage relationship between spot rates, forward rates, and interest rates; calculate and interpret a forward discount or premium; calculate and interpret the forward rate consistent with the spot rate and the interest rate in each currency; describe exchange rate regimes; explain the effects of exchange rates on countries international trade and capital flows.

In this reading, we have described the diverse array of FX market participants and have introduced some of the basic concepts necessary to understand the structure and functions of these markets. The reader should be able to understand how exchange rates—both spot and forward—are quoted and be able to calculate cross exchange rates and forward rates. We also have described the array of exchange rate regimes that characterize foreign exchange markets globally and how these regimes determine the flexibility of exchange rates, and hence, the degree of foreign exchange rate risk that international investments are exposed to. Finally, we have discussed how movements in exchange rates affect international trade flows (imports and exports) and capital flows. The following points, among others, are made in this reading: Measured by average daily turnover, the foreign exchange market is by far the largest financial market in the world. It has important effects, either directly or indirectly, on the pricing and flows in all other financial markets. There is a wide diversity of global FX market participants that have a wide variety of motives for entering into foreign exchange transactions. Individual currencies are usually referred to by standardized three-character codes. These currency codes can also be used to define exchange rates (the price of one currency in terms of another). There are a variety of exchange rate quoting conventions commonly used. A direct currency quote takes the domestic currency as the price currency and the foreign currency as the base currency (i.e., Sd/f). An indirect quote uses the domestic currency as the base currency (i.e., Sf/d). To convert between direct and indirect quotes, the inverse (reciprocal) is used. Professional FX markets use standardized conventions for how the exchange rate for specific currency pairs will be quoted. Currencies trade in foreign exchange markets based on nominal exchange rates. An increase (decrease) in the exchange rate, quoted in indirect terms, means that the domestic currency is appreciating (depreciating) versus the foreign currency. The real exchange rate, defined as the nominal exchange rate multiplied by the ratio of price levels, measures the relative purchasing power of the currencies. An increase in the real exchange rate (Rd/f) implies a reduction in the relative purchasing power of the domestic currency. Given exchange rates for two currency pairs—A/B and A/C—we can compute the cross-rate (B/C) between currencies B and C. Depending on how the rates are quoted, this may require inversion of one of the quoted rates. Spot exchange rates are for immediate settlement (typically, T + 2), while forward exchange rates are for settlement at agreed-upon future dates. Forward rates can be used to manage foreign exchange risk exposures or can be combined with spot transactions to create FX swaps. The spot exchange rate, the forward exchange rate, and the domestic and foreign interest rates must jointly satisfy an arbitrage relationship that equates the investment return on two alternative but equivalent investments. Given the spot exchange rate and the foreign and domestic interest rates, the forward exchange rate must take the value that prevents riskless arbitrage. Forward rates are typically quoted in terms of forward (or swap) points. The swap points are added to the spot exchange rate in order to calculate the forward rate. Occasionally, forward rates are presented in terms of percentages relative to the spot rate. The base currency is said to be trading at a forward premium if the forward rate is above the spot rate (forward points are positive). Conversely, the base currency is said to be trading at a forward discount if the forward rate is below the spot rate (forward points are negative). The currency with the higher (lower) interest rate will trade at a forward discount (premium). Swap points are proportional to the spot exchange rate and to the interest rate differential and approximately proportional to the term of the forward contract. Empirical studies suggest that forward exchange rates may be unbiased predictors of future spot rates, but the margin of error on such forecasts is too large for them to be used in practice as a guide to managing exchange rate exposures. FX markets are too complex and too intertwined with other global financial markets to be adequately characterized by a single variable, such as the interest rate differential. Virtually every exchange rate is managed to some degree by central banks. The policy framework that each central bank adopts is called an exchange rate regime. These regimes range from using another countrys currency (dollarization), to letting the market determine the exchange rate (independent float). In practice, most regimes fall in between these extremes. The type of exchange rate regime used varies widely among countries and over time. An ideal currency regime would have three properties: (1) the exchange rate between any two currencies would be credibly fixed; (2) all currencies would be fully convertible; and (3) each country would be able to undertake fully independent monetary policy in pursuit of domestic objectives, such as growth and inflation targets. However, these conditions are inconsistent. In particular, a fixed exchange rate and unfettered capital flows severely limit a countrys ability to undertake independent monetary policy. Hence, there cannot be an ideal currency regime. The IMF identifies the following types of regimes: arrangements with no separate legal tender (dollarization, monetary union), currency board, fixed parity, target zone, crawling peg, crawling band, managed float, and independent float. Most major currencies traded in FX markets are freely floating, albeit subject to occasional central bank intervention. A trade surplus (deficit) must be matched by a corresponding deficit (surplus) in the capital account. Any factor that affects the trade balance must have an equal and opposite impact on the capital account, and vice versa. A trade surplus reflects an excess of domestic saving (including the government fiscal balance) over investment spending. A trade deficit indicates that the country invests more than it saves and must finance the excess by borrowing from foreigners or selling assets to foreigners. The impact of the exchange rate on trade and capital flows can be analyzed from two perspectives. The elasticities approach focuses on the effect of changing the relative price of domestic and foreign goods. This approach highlights changes in the composition of spending. The absorption approach focuses on the impact of exchange rates on aggregate expenditure/saving decisions. The elasticities approach leads to the Marshall–Lerner condition, which describes combinations of export and import demand elasticities such that depreciation (appreciation) of the domestic currency will move the trade balance toward surplus (deficit). The idea underlying the Marshall–Lerner condition is that demand for imports and exports must be sufficiently price-sensitive so that an increase in the relative price of imports increases the difference between export receipts and import expenditures. In order to move the trade balance toward surplus (deficit), a change in the exchange rate must decrease (increase) domestic expenditure (also called absorption) relative to income. Equivalently, it must increase (decrease) domestic saving relative to domestic investment. If there is excess capacity in the economy, then currency depreciation can increase output/income by switching demand toward domestically produced goods and services. Because some of the additional income will be saved, income rises relative to expenditure and the trade balance improves. If the economy is at full employment, then currency depreciation must reduce domestic expenditure in order to improve the trade balance. The main mechanism is a wealth effect: A weaker currency reduces the purchasing power of domestic-currency-denominated assets (including the present value of current and future earned income), and households respond by reducing expenditure and increasing saving.

"Faced with an overwhelming amount of data, analysts must deal with the task of wrangling those data into something that provides a clearer picture of what is going on. We use the concepts and tools of hypothesis testing to address these issues. Hypothesis testing is part of statistical inference, the process of making judgments about a larger group (a population) based on a smaller group of observations (that is, a sample). The concepts and tools of hypothesis testing provide an objective means to gauge whether the available evidence supports the hypothesis. After applying a statistical test of a hypothesis, we should have a clearer idea of the probability that a hypothesis is true or not, although our conclusion always stops short of certainty. The main focus of this reading is on the framework of hypothesis testing and tests concerning mean, variance, and correlation, three quantities frequently used in investments.","The member should be able to: define a hypothesis, describe the steps of hypothesis testing, and describe and interpret the choice of the null and alternative hypotheses; compare and contrast one-tailed and two-tailed tests of hypotheses; explain a test statistic, Type I and Type II errors, a significance level, how significance levels are used in hypothesis testing, and the power of a test; explain a decision rule and the relation between confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, and determine whether a statistically significant result is also economically meaningful. explain and interpret the p-value as it relates to hypothesis testing; describe how to interpret the significance of a test in the context of multiple tests; identify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results for a hypothesis test concerning the population mean of both large and small samples when the population is normally or approximately normally distributed and the variance is (1) known or (2) unknown; identify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results for a hypothesis test concerning the equality of the population means of two at least approximately normally distributed populations based on independent random samples with equal assumed variances; identify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results for a hypothesis test concerning the mean difference of two normally distributed populations; identify the appropriate test statistic and interpret the results for a hypothesis test concerning (1) the variance of a normally distributed population and (2) the equality of the variances of two normally distributed populations based on two independent random samples; compare and contrast parametric and nonparametric tests, and describe situations where each is the more appropriate type of test; explain parametric and nonparametric tests of the hypothesis that the population correlation coefficient equals zero, and determine whether the hypothesis is rejected at a given level of significance; explain tests of independence based on contingency table data.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V1R8_hypothesis_testing.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/hypothesis-testing,"In this reading, we have presented the concepts and methods of statistical inference and hypothesis testing. A hypothesis is a statement about one or more populations. The steps in testing a hypothesis are as follows: State the hypotheses. Identify the appropriate test statistic and its probability distribution. Specify the significance level. State the decision rule. Collect the data and calculate the test statistic. Make a decision. We state two hypotheses: The null hypothesis is the hypothesis to be tested; the alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis accepted if the null hypothesis is rejected. There are three ways to formulate hypotheses. Let q indicate the population parameters: Two-sided alternative: H0: θ = θ0 versus Ha: θ ¹ θ0 One-sided alternative (right side): H0: θ £ θ0 versus Ha: θ &gt; θ0 One-sided alternative (left side): H0: θ ³ θ0 versus Ha: θ &lt; θ0where θ0 is a hypothesized value of the population parameter and θ is the true value of the population parameter. When we have a suspected or hoped for condition for which we want to find supportive evidence, we frequently set up that condition as the alternative hypothesis and use a one-sided test. However, the researcher may select a not equal to alternative hypothesis and conduct a two-sided test to emphasize a neutral attitude. A test statistic is a quantity, calculated using a sample, whose value is the basis for deciding whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. We compare the computed value of the test statistic to a critical value for the same test statistic to decide whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. In reaching a statistical decision, we can make two possible errors: We may reject a true null hypothesis (a Type I error, or false positive), or we may fail to reject a false null hypothesis (a Type II error, or false negative). The level of significance of a test is the probability of a Type I error that we accept in conducting a hypothesis test. The standard approach to hypothesis testing involves specifying only a level of significance (that is, the probability of a Type I error). The complement of the level of significance is the confidence level. The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null (rejecting the null when it is false). The complement of the power of the test is the probability of a Type II error. A decision rule consists of determining the critical values with which to compare the test statistic to decide whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. When we reject the null hypothesis, the result is said to be statistically significant. The (1 − a) confidence interval represents the range of values of the test statistic for which the null hypothesis is not be rejected. The statistical decision consists of rejecting or not rejecting the null hypothesis. The economic decision takes into consideration all economic issues pertinent to the decision. The p-value is the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis can be rejected. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The p-value approach to hypothesis testing involves computing a p-value for the test statistic and allowing the user of the research to interpret the implications for the null hypothesis. For hypothesis tests concerning the population mean of a normally distributed population with unknown variance, the theoretically correct test statistic is the t-statistic. When we want to test whether the observed difference between two means is statistically significant, we must first decide whether the samples are independent or dependent (related). If the samples are independent, we conduct a test concerning differences between means. If the samples are dependent, we conduct a test of mean differences (paired comparisons test). When we conduct a test of the difference between two population means from normally distributed populations with unknown but equal variances, we use a t-test based on pooling the observations of the two samples to estimate the common but unknown variance. This test is based on an assumption of independent samples. In tests concerning two means based on two samples that are not independent, we often can arrange the data in paired observations and conduct a test of mean differences (a paired comparisons test). When the samples are from normally distributed populations with unknown variances, the appropriate test statistic is t-distributed. In tests concerning the variance of a single normally distributed population, the test statistic is chi-square with n − 1 degrees of freedom, where n is sample size. For tests concerning differences between the variances of two normally distributed populations based on two random, independent samples, the appropriate test statistic is based on an F-test (the ratio of the sample variances). The degrees of freedom for this F-test are n1 − 1 and n2 − 1, where n1 corresponds to the number of observations in the calculation of the numerator and n2 is the number of observations in the calculation of the denominator of the F-statistic. A parametric test is a hypothesis test concerning a population parameter or a hypothesis test based on specific distributional assumptions. In contrast, a nonparametric test either is not concerned with a parameter or makes minimal assumptions about the population from which the sample comes. A nonparametric test is primarily used when data do not meet distributional assumptions, when there are outliers, when data are given in ranks, or when the hypothesis we are addressing does not concern a parameter. In tests concerning correlation, we use a t-statistic to test whether a population correlation coefficient is different from zero. If we have n observations for two variables, this test statistic has a t-distribution with n − 2 degrees of freedom. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is calculated on the ranks of two variables within their respective samples. A chi-square distributed test statistic is used to test for independence of two categorical variables. This nonparametric test compares actual frequencies with those expected on the basis of independence. This test statistic has degrees of freedom of (r − 1)(c − 2), where r is the number of categories for the first variable and c is the number of categories of the second variable.",Hypothesis Testing,2024
"Fixed-income securities constitute the most prevalent means of raising capital globally based on total market value. These instruments allow governments, companies, and other issuers to borrow from investors, promising future interest payments and the return of principal, which are contractual (legal) obligations of the issuer. Fixed-income securities are the largest source of capital for government, not-for-profit, and other entities that do not issue equity. For private companies, fixed-income investors differ from shareholders in not having ownership rights. Payments of interest and repayment of principal (amount borrowed) are a higher priority claim on the companys earnings and assets compared with the claim of common shareholders. Since fixed-income claims rank above shareholder claims in the capital structure, a companys fixed-income securities have, in theory, lower risk than their common shares. Financial analysts who master these and other fixed-income concepts have a distinct edge over their peers for several reasons. First, given the nature of fixed-income cash flows and their preponderance across issuers and regions, these instruments form the basis for risk versus return comparisons both across and within specific jurisdictions. For example, as bonds issued by the US Treasury and other developed market central governments are viewed as having little to no default risk, they serve as building blocks in determining the time value of money for less certain cash flows. Fixed-income securities also fulfill an important role in portfolio management as a prime means by which individual and institutional investors can fund known future obligations, such as tuition payments or retirement obligations. Finally, while the correlation of fixed-income returns with common share returns varies, adding fixed-income securities to portfolios that include common shares can be an effective way of obtaining diversification benefits. Among the questions to be addressed are the following: Which features define a fixed-income security, and how do they determine the scheduled cash flows? What are the legal, regulatory, and tax considerations associated with a fixed-income security, and why are they important for investors? What are the common interest and principal payment structures? What types of provisions may affect the disposal or redemption of fixed-income securities? Note that the terms fixed-income securities, debt securities, and bonds are often used interchangeably by experts and non-experts alike. We will also follow this convention, and where any nuance of meaning is intended, it will be made clear. Moreover, the term fixed income is not to be understood literally: Some fixed-income securities have interest payments that change over time.","The member should be able to: describe basic features of a fixed-income security; compare affirmative and negative covenants and identify examples of each; describe how legal, regulatory, and tax considerations affect the issuance and trading of fixed-income securities; describe how cash flows of fixed-income securities are structured; describe contingency provisions affecting the timing and/or nature of cash flows of fixed-income securities and whether such provisions benefit the borrower or the lender.",Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V4R10-fixed-income-securities-defining-elements.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/fixed-income-securities-defining-elements,"This reading introduces the salient features of fixed-income securities while noting how these features vary among different types of securities. Important points include the following: The three important elements that an investor needs to know when investing in a fixed-income security are: (1) the bonds features, which determine its scheduled cash flows and thus the bondholders expected and actual return; (2) the legal, regulatory, and tax considerations that apply to the contractual agreement between the issuer and the bondholders; and (3) the contingency provisions that may affect the bonds scheduled cash flows. The basic features of a bond include the issuer, maturity, par value (or principal), coupon rate and frequency, and currency denomination. Issuers of bonds include supranational organizations, sovereign governments, non-sovereign governments, quasi-government entities, and corporate issuers. Bondholders are exposed to credit risk and may use bond credit ratings to assess the credit quality of a bond. A bonds principal is the amount the issuer agrees to pay the bondholder when the bond matures. The coupon rate is the interest rate that the issuer agrees to pay to the bondholder each year. The coupon rate can be a fixed rate or a floating rate. Bonds may offer annual, semi-annual, quarterly, or monthly coupon payments depending on the type of bond and where the bond is issued. Bonds can be issued in any currency. Such bonds as dual-currency bonds and currency option bonds are connected to two currencies. The yield-to-maturity is the discount rate that equates the present value of the bonds future cash flows until maturity to its price. Yield-to-maturity can be considered an estimate of the markets expectation for the bonds return. A plain vanilla bond has a known cash flow pattern. It has a fixed maturity date and pays a fixed rate of interest over the bonds life. The bond indenture or trust deed is the legal contract that describes the form of the bond, the issuers obligations, and the investors rights. The indenture is usually held by a financial institution called a trustee, which performs various duties specified in the indenture. The issuer is identified in the indenture by its legal name and is obligated to make timely payments of interest and repayment of principal. For asset-backed securities, the legal obligation to repay bondholders often lies with a separate legal entity—that is, a bankruptcy-remote vehicle that uses the assets as guarantees to back a bond issue. How the issuer intends to service the debt and repay the principal should be described in the indenture. The source of repayment proceeds varies depending on the type of bond. Collateral backing is a way to alleviate credit risk. Secured bonds are backed by assets or financial guarantees pledged to ensure debt payment. Examples of collateral-backed bonds include collateral trust bonds, equipment trust certificates, mortgage-backed securities, and covered bonds. Credit enhancement can be internal or external. Examples of internal credit enhancement include subordination, overcollateralization, and reserve accounts. A bank guarantee, a surety bond, a letter of credit, and a cash collateral account are examples of external credit enhancement. Bond covenants are legally enforceable rules that borrowers and lenders agree on at the time of a new bond issue. Affirmative covenants enumerate what issuers are required to do, whereas negative covenants enumerate what issuers are prohibited from doing. An important consideration for investors is where the bonds are issued and traded, because it affects the laws, regulation, and tax status that apply. Bonds issued in a country in local currency are domestic bonds if they are issued by entities incorporated in the country and foreign bonds if they are issued by entities incorporated in another country. Eurobonds are issued internationally, outside the jurisdiction of any single country and are subject to a lower level of listing, disclosure, and regulatory requirements than domestic or foreign bonds. Global bonds are issued in the Eurobond market and at least one domestic market at the same time. Although some bonds may offer special tax advantages, as a general rule, interest is taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. Some countries also implement a capital gains tax. There may be specific tax provisions for bonds issued at a discount or bought at a premium An amortizing bond is a bond whose payment schedule requires periodic payment of interest and repayment of principal. This differs from a bullet bond, whose entire payment of principal occurs at maturity. The amortizing bonds outstanding principal amount is reduced to zero by the maturity date for a fully amortized bond, but a balloon payment is required at maturity to retire the bonds outstanding principal amount for a partially amortized bond. Sinking fund agreements provide another approach to the periodic retirement of principal, in which an amount of the bonds principal outstanding amount is usually repaid each year throughout the bonds life or after a specified date. A floating-rate note, or floater, is a bond whose coupon is set based on a market reference rate (MRR) plus a spread. FRNs can be floored, capped, or collared. An inverse FRN is a bond whose coupon has an inverse relationship to the reference rate. Other coupon payment structures include bonds with step-up coupons, which pay coupons that increase by specified amounts on specified dates; bonds with credit-linked coupons, which change when the issuers credit rating changes; bonds with payment-in-kind coupons, which allow the issuer to pay coupons with additional amounts of the bond issue rather than in cash; and bonds with deferred coupons, which pay no coupons in the early years following the issue but higher coupons thereafter. The payment structures for index-linked bonds vary considerably among countries. A common index-linked bond is an inflation-linked bond, or linker, whose coupon payments and/or principal repayments are linked to a price index. Index-linked payment structures include zero-coupon-indexed bonds, interest-indexed bonds, capital-indexed bonds, and indexed-annuity bonds. Common types of bonds with embedded options include callable bonds, putable bonds, and convertible bonds. These options are embedded in the sense that there are provisions provided in the indenture that grant either the issuer or the bondholder certain rights affecting the disposal or redemption of the bond. They are not separately traded securities. Callable bonds give the issuer the right to buy bonds back prior to maturity, thereby raising the reinvestment risk for the bondholder. For this reason, callable bonds have to offer a higher yield and sell at a lower price than otherwise similar non-callable bonds to compensate the bondholders for the value of the call option to the issuer. Putable bonds give the bondholder the right to sell bonds back to the issuer prior to maturity. Putable bonds offer a lower yield and sell at a higher price than otherwise similar non-putable bonds to compensate the issuer for the value of the put option to the bondholders. A convertible bond gives the bondholder the right to convert the bond into common shares of the issuing company. Because this option favors the bondholder, convertible bonds offer a lower yield and sell at a higher price than otherwise similar non-convertible bonds.",Fixed-Income Securities: Defining Elements,2023

"Performance evaluation is one of the most critical areas of investment analysis. Performance results can be used to assess the quality of the investment approach and suggest changes that might improve it. They are also used to communicate the results of the investment process to other stakeholders and may even be used to compensate the investment managers. Therefore, it is of vital importance that practitioners who use these analyses understand how the results are generated. By gaining an understanding of the details of how these analyses work, practitioners will develop a greater understanding of the insights that might be gathered from the analysis and will also be cognizant of the limitations of those approaches, careful not to infer more than what is explicit or logically implicit in the results. We will first consider the broad categories of performance measurement, attribution, and appraisal, differentiating between the three and explaining their interrelationships. Next, we will provide practitioners with tools to evaluate the effectiveness of those analyses as we summarize various approaches to performance evaluation. We will cover returns-based, holdings-based, and transactions-based attribution, addressing the merits and shortcomings of each approach and providing guidance on how to properly interpret attribution results. Again, by reviewing how each approach generates its results, we reveal strengths and weaknesses of the individual attribution approaches. Next, we will turn to the subject of benchmarks and performance appraisal ratios. We will review the long-standing tests of benchmark quality and differentiate market indexes from benchmarks. We will also review different ratios used in performance appraisal, considering the benefits and limitations of each approach. Lastly, we will provide advice on using these tools to collectively evaluate the skill of investment managers. This advice relies heavily on understanding the analysis tools, the limitations of the approaches, the importance of data to the quality of the analysis, and the pitfalls to avoid when making recommendations.","The member should be able to: explain the following components of portfolio evaluation and their interrelationships: performance measurement, performance attribution, and performance appraisal; describe attributes of an effective attribution process; distinguish between return attribution and risk attribution and between macro and micro return attribution; describe returns-based, holdings-based, and transactions-based performance attribution, including advantages and disadvantages of each; interpret the sources of portfolio returns using a specified attribution approach; interpret the output from fixed-income attribution analyses; discuss considerations in selecting a risk attribution approach; distinguish between investment results attributable to the asset owner versus those attributable to the investment manager; discuss uses of liability-based benchmarks; describe types of asset-based benchmarks; discuss tests of benchmark quality; describe problems that arise in benchmarking alternative investments; describe the impact of benchmark misspecification on attribution and appraisal analysis; calculate and interpret the Sortino ratio, the appraisal ratio, upside/downside capture ratios, maximum drawdown, and drawdown duration; describe limitations of appraisal measures and related metrics; evaluate the skill of an investment manager.",Level III,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V5R3_portfolio_performance_evaluation.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/portfolio-performance-evaluation,"Performance evaluation is an essential tool for understanding the quality of the investment process. Practitioners must take care, however, to understand how performance results are generated. They need a good understanding of the performance methods used, the data inputs, and the limitations of those methods. They particularly need to be careful not to infer results beyond the capabilities of the methods or the accuracy of the data. In this reading, we have discussed the following: Performance measurement provides an overall indication of the portfolios performance. Performance attribution builds on performance measurement to explain how the performance was achieved. Performance appraisal leverages both returns and attribution to infer the quality of the investment process. An effective attribution process must reconcile to the total portfolio return/risk, reflect the investment decision-making process, quantify the active portfolio management decisions, and provide a complete understanding of the excess return/risk of the portfolio. Return attribution analyzes the impact of investment decisions on the returns, whereas risk attribution analyzes the risk consequences of the investment decisions. Macro attribution considers the decisions of the fund sponsor, whereas micro attribution considers the decisions of the individual portfolio manager. Returns-based attribution uses returns to identify the factors that have generated those returns. Holdings-based attribution uses the holdings over time to evaluate the decisions that contributed to the returns. Transactions-based attribution uses both holdings and transactions to fully explain the performance over the evaluation period. There are various techniques for interpreting the sources of portfolio returns using a specified attribution approach. Fixed-income attribution considers the unique factors that drive bond returns, including interest rate risk and default risk. When selecting a risk attribution approach, practitioners should consider the investment decision-making process and the type of attribution analysis. Attribution is used to calculate and interpret the contribution to portfolio return and volatility from the asset allocation and within-asset-class active/passive decisions. Liability-based benchmarks focus on the cash flows that the assets are required to generate. Asset-based benchmarks contain a collection of assets to compare against the portfolios assets. Valid benchmarks should be unambiguous, investable, measurable, appropriate, reflective of current investment opinions, specified in advance, and accountable. Benchmark misspecification creates subsequent incorrect performance measurement and invalidates the attribution and appraisal analyses. Alternative investments are difficult to benchmark because they are typically less liquid, have fewer available market benchmarks, and often lack transparency. Investment performance appraisal ratios—including the Sortino ratio, upside/downside capture ratios, maximum drawdown, and drawdown duration—measure investment skill. Appraisal ratios must be used with care, noting the assumptions of each ratio and affording the appropriateness to the measured investment process, risk tolerance, and investor time horizon. Although appraisal ratios help identify manager skill (as opposed to luck), they often are based on investment return data, which are often limited and subject to error. Evaluation of investment manager skill requires the use of a broad range of analysis tools, with fundamental understanding of how the tools work, how they complement each other, and their specific limitations.",Portfolio Performance Evaluation,2024
"As a candidate in the CFA Program, you are both expected and required to meet high ethical standards. This reading introduces ideas and concepts that will help you understand the importance of ethical behavior in the investment industry. You will be introduced to various types of ethical issues within the investment profession and learn about the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. The readings covering ethics and professional standards demonstrate that ethical behavior is central to creating trust. Professional behavior is equally important. Professions help maintain trust in an industry by establishing codes and setting standards that put a framework around ethical behavior and technical competence. Professions also set the wider goal of gaining and maintaining the trust of society as a whole. In this regard, professions have a sense of purpose that society values. Imagine that you are employed in the research department of a large financial services firm. You and your colleagues spend your days researching, analyzing, and valuing the shares of publicly traded companies and sharing your investment recommendations with clients. You love your work and take great satisfaction in knowing that your recommendations can help the firms investing clients make informed investment decisions that will help them meet their financial goals and improve their lives. Several months after starting at the firm, you learn that an analyst at the firm has been terminated for writing and publishing research reports that misrepresented the fundamental risks of some companies to investors. You learn that the analyst wrote the reports with the goal of pleasing the management of the companies that were the subjects of the research reports. He hoped that these companies would hire your firms investment banking division for its services and he would be rewarded with large bonuses for helping the firm increase its investment banking fees. Some clients bought shares based on the analysts reports and suffered losses. They posted stories on the internet about their losses and the misleading nature of the reports. When the media investigated and published the story, the firms reputation for investment research suffered. Investors began to question the firms motives and the objectivity of its research recommendations. The firms investment clients started to look elsewhere for investment advice, and company clients begin to transfer their business to firms with untarnished reputations. With business declining, management is forced to trim staff. Along with many other hard-working colleagues, you lose your job—through no fault of your own. Imagine how you would feel in this situation. Most people would feel upset and resentful that their hard and honest work was derailed by someone elses unethical behavior. Yet, this type of scenario is not uncommon. Around the world, unsuspecting employees at such companies as SAC Capital, Stanford Financial Group, Everbright Securities, Enron, Satyam Computer Services, Arthur Andersen, and other large companies have experienced such career setbacks when someone elses actions destroyed trust in their companies and industries. Businesses and financial markets thrive on trust—defined as a strong belief in the reliability of a person or institution. In a 2016 study on trust, investors indicated that to earn their trust, the top two attributes of an investment manager should be that it (1) has transparent and open business practices, and (2) has ethical business practices. Although these attributes are valued by customers and clients in any industry, this reading will explore why they are of particular importance to the investment industry. People may think that ethical behavior is simply about following laws, regulations, and other rules, but throughout our lives and careers we will encounter situations in which there is no definitive rule that specifies how to act, or the rules that exist may be unclear or even in conflict with each other. Responsible people, including investment professionals, must be willing and able to identify potential ethical issues and create solutions to them even in the absence of clearly stated rules.",The member should be able to: explain ethics; describe the role of a code of ethics in defining a profession; describe professions and how they establish trust; describe the need for high ethical standards in investment management; explain professionalism in investment management; identify challenges to ethical behavior; distinguish between ethical and legal standards; describe a framework for ethical decision making.,Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V6R5_ethics_trust_investment_profession.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/ethics-and-trust-investment-profession,,Ethics and Trust in the Investment Profession,2024

"This reading explains the rationale and application of certain provisions of the 2020 edition of the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) for Firms. The 2020 edition of the GIPS standards contains three chapters: the GIPS Standards for Firms, the GIPS Standards for Asset Owners, and the GIPS Standards for Verifiers, each with its own glossary. Candidates are responsible not only for the material contained directly in this reading but also for the sections of the GIPS Standards for Firms specifically referenced within this reading. The entirety of the 2020 GIPS Standards for Firms can be found here: https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/ethics/codes/gips-standards/firms The GIPS standards fulfill an essential role in investment management around the world. They meet the need for globally accepted standards for investment management firms in calculating and presenting their investment returns to prospective clients and prospective investors. (In the context of the GIPS Standards for Firms, a prospective client is any person or entity that has expressed interest in one of the firms strategies and qualifies to invest in that strategy via a segregated account, irrespective of whether the person or entity currently invests with the firm through another strategy that the firm offers. A prospective investor is any person or entity that has expressed interest in one of the firms pooled funds and qualifies to invest in the pooled fund, again irrespective of any other current investments with the firm. These and other terms bolded in this reading are defined in the glossary of the GIPS Standards for Firms. For purposes of this reading, the terms client and investor may be used interchangeably.) The GIPS standards are based on the ideals of fair representation and full disclosure of an investment management firms performance history. Firms that claim compliance with the GIPS standards must adhere to rules governing not only return calculations but also the way in which returns are displayed in a GIPS Report. (A GIPS Report is a specific type of performance presentation that must be provided to prospective clients and investors when a firm claims compliance with the GIPS standards.) They are further required to make certain disclosures and are encouraged to make others in a GIPS Report, thereby assisting the user in interpreting and evaluating the reported returns. Prospective and current clients can have a high degree of confidence that the information shown in a GIPS Report reflects the results of the firms past investment decisions. They can also be confident that the returns are calculated and presented on a consistent basis and are objectively comparable for a given strategy with those reported by other firms claiming compliance with the GIPS standards.","The member should be able to: discuss the objectives and scope of the GIPS standards and their benefits to prospective clients and investors, as well as investment managers; explain the fundamentals of compliance with the GIPS standards, including the definition of the firm and the firms definition of discretion; discuss requirements of the GIPS standards with respect to return calculation methodologies, including the treatment of external cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and expenses and fees; explain requirements of the GIPS standards with respect to composite return calculations, including methods for asset-weighting portfolio returns; explain the meaning of discretionary in the context of composite construction and, given a description of the relevant facts, determine whether a portfolio is likely to be considered discretionary; explain the role of investment mandates, objectives, or strategies in the construction of composites; explain requirements of the GIPS standards with respect to composite construction, including switching portfolios among composites, the timing of the inclusion of new portfolios in composites, and the timing of the exclusion of terminated portfolios from composites; explain requirements of the GIPS standards with respect to presentation and reporting; explain the conditions under which the performance of a past firm or affiliation may be linked to or used to represent the historical performance of a new or acquiring firm; explain the recommended valuation hierarchy of the GIPS standards; discuss the purpose, scope, and process of verification.",Level III,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L3V6R5-overview-global-investment-performance-standards.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/gips-overview,"The Global Investment Performance Standards for Firms meet the need for globally accepted standards for investment management firms in calculating and presenting their results to clients and prospective clients. The GIPS standards will continue to evolve to address additional aspects of performance presentation. Firms that claim compliance must meet all applicable requirements, including not only the provisions of the GIPS standards but also any Guidance Statements, interpretations, and Questions &amp; Answers published by CFA Institute and the GIPS standards governing bodies. Practitioners should register for the GIPS Newsletter to stay informed about existing and new requirements and recommended best practices. CFA Institute and other organizations offer publications and conduct conferences and workshops designed to help practitioners implement and maintain compliance with the GIPS standards. This reading has made the following points: Only investment management firms and asset owners that manage assets on a discretionary basis—and compete for business—may claim compliance with the GIPS Standards for Firms. The objectives of the GIPS standards are as follows: (1) Promote investor interests and instill investor confidence; (2) ensure accurate and consistent data; (3) obtain worldwide acceptance of a single standard for calculating and presenting performance; (4) promote fair, global competition among investment firms; and (5) promote industry self-regulation on a global basis. When the GIPS standards conflict with law and/or regulations regarding the calculation and presentation of performance, firms must comply with the law or regulations and disclose the conflict in the GIPS Report. Required fundamentals of compliance with the GIPS standards include properly defining the firm, providing GIPS Reports to all prospective clients/investors, adhering to applicable laws and regulations, and ensuring that information presented is not false or misleading. A firm is an investment firm, subsidiary, or division held out to the public as a distinct business entity. A composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. The composite return is the weighted average of the return of all portfolios in the composite. All discretionary, fee-paying, segregated accounts must be included in at least one composite. All discretionary, fee-paying pooled funds must be included in any composite for which they meet the composite definition. A portfolio is discretionary if the firm is able to implement the intended investment strategy. Firms must formulate, document, and adhere to composite- and pooled fund–specific policies for the treatment of external cash flows and to adhere to those policies consistently. The GIPS standards mandate the use of certain calculation methodologies to facilitate comparability of results among firms. Time-weighted returns are required for all portfolios except portfolios meeting certain criteria. Money-weighted returns may be presented instead of time-weighted returns if the firm has control over the external cash flows into the portfolios in the composite or the pooled fund and at least one of the following conditions is met: the portfolios in the composite are (or the pooled fund is): 1) closed-end; 2) fixed life; 3) fixed commitment; or 4) have illiquid investments as a significant part of the investment strategy. Returns for periods of less than one year must not be annualized. Returns from cash and cash equivalents must be included in all total return calculations. Returns must be calculated after the deduction of transaction costs. Assets must be valued using a fair value methodology. If objective, observable, unadjusted quoted market prices for identical investments in active markets on the measurement date are available, they must be used. If they are not available, firms may use, in this order: (1) quoted prices for similar investments in markets that are active; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active; (3) market-based inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable for the investment; or (4) subjective, unobservable inputs. A firm must have a clear, written definition of discretion that is consistently applied. Firms may not link the theoretical performance of simulated or model portfolios with actual performance. GIPS Composite Reports that present TWRs must include the following key items: at least five years of annual performance (unless the composite has been in existence for a shorter period), building to a minimum of 10 years of returns; composite and benchmark annual returns for all years; the number of portfolios (if six or more) in the composite at each period end; the amount of assets in the composite; the amount of total firm assets at the end of each period; a measure of internal dispersion of individual portfolio returns for each annual period and, where monthly returns are available; and the three-year annualized ex post standard deviation of the composite and of the benchmark as of each annual period end. Performance from a past firm or affiliation may be linked to the performance of the new or acquiring firm if (1) substantially all the investment decision makers are employed by the new or acquiring firm, (2) the decision-making process remains substantially intact and independent within the new or acquiring firm, (3) the new or acquiring firm has records that document and support the reported performance, and (4) there is no break in the track record between the past firm or affiliation and the new or acquiring firm. Verification provides assurance on whether the firms policies and procedures related to composite and pooled fund maintenance, as well as the calculation, presentation, and distribution of performance have been designed in compliance with the GIPS standards and have been implemented on a firm-wide basis. Verifiers must determine if the firm satisfies the GIPS standards requirements with respect to recordkeeping, policies and procedures, the definition of the firm, the completeness of the list of composites and limited distribution pooled fund descriptions, and the calculation of total firm assets. A verification report may be issued only with respect to the whole firm.",Overview of the Global Investment Performance Standards,2023
"This reading discusses trading and execution from a portfolio managers perspective. The reading covers a broad range of topics related to trade strategy selection and implementation and trade cost measurement and evaluation. Growth in electronic trading has led to increased automation in trading, including the use of algorithmic trading and machine learning to optimize trade strategy and execution. Various markets, including equities, fixed income, derivatives, and foreign exchange, are examined. Adequate trading processes and procedures are also discussed from a regulatory and governance perspective. Portfolio managers need to work closely with traders to determine the most appropriate trading strategy given their motivation for trading, risk aversion, trade urgency, and other factors, such as order characteristics and market conditions. Trade execution should be well integrated with the portfolio management process, and although trading strategies will vary on the basis of market and security type, all trade activity should be evaluated for execution quality and to assess broker and trade venue performance consistent with the funds objectives. Additionally, firms should have proper documentation of trade procedures in place to meet regulatory and governance standards. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses portfolio manager motivations to trade. Section 3 discusses inputs to trade strategy selection and the trade strategy selection process. Section 4 covers the range of trade implementation choices and trading algorithms and provides a comparison of various markets. Section 5 explains how trade costs are measured and how to evaluate trade execution. Section 6 provides guidance on evaluating a firms trading procedures for good governance practices. Section 7 concludes and summarizes the reading.","The member should be able to: discuss motivations to trade and how they relate to trading strategy; discuss inputs to the selection of a trading strategy; compare benchmarks for trade execution; select and justify a trading strategy (given relevant facts); describe factors that typically determine the selection of a trading algorithm class; contrast key characteristics of the following markets in relation to trade implementation: equity, fixed income, options and futures, OTC derivatives, and spot currency; explain how trade costs are measured and determine the cost of a trade; evaluate the execution of a trade; evaluate a firms trading procedures, including processes, disclosures, and record keeping with respect to good governance.",Level III,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V5R2_trade_strategy_and_execution.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/trade-strategy-execution,"Portfolio manager motivations to trade include profit seeking, risk management (hedging), liquidity driven (fund flows), and corporate actions and index reconstitutions. Managers following a short-term alpha-driven strategy will trade with greater urgency to realize alpha before it dissipates (decays). Managers following a longer-term strategy will trade with less urgency if alpha decay is expected to be slower. Trading is required to keep portfolios at targeted risk levels or risk exposures, to hedge risks that may be outside a portfolio managers investment objectives or that the portfolio manager does not have an investment view on. Trading may be liquidity driven resulting from client activity or index reconstitutions. In these cases, managers typically trade using end-of-day closing prices because these prices are used for fund and benchmark valuation. Inputs affecting trade strategy selection include the following types: order related, security related, market related, and user based. Order characteristics include the side (or trade direction) and size of an order. Percentage of average daily volume is a standardized measure used in trading that indicates what order size can realistically be traded. Large trades are generally traded over longer time horizons to minimize market impact. Security characteristics include security type, short-term (trade) alpha, security price volatility, and a securitys liquidity profile. Market conditions at the time of trading (intraday trading volumes, bid–ask spreads, and security and market volatility) should be incorporated into trade strategy since they can differ from anticipated conditions. Market volatility and liquidity vary over time, and liquidity considerations may differ substantially during periods of crisis. Individuals with higher levels of risk aversion are more concerned with market risk and tend to trade with greater urgency. Market impact is the adverse price impact in a security caused from trading an order and can represent one of the largest costs in trading. Execution risk is the adverse price impact resulting from a change in the fundamental value of the security and is often proxied by price volatility. Reference price benchmarks inform order trading prices and include pre-trade, intraday, post-trade, and price target benchmarks. Managers seeking short-term alpha will use pre-trade benchmarks, such as the arrival price, when they wish to transact close to current market prices (greater trade urgency). Managers without views on short-term price movements who wish to participate in volumes over the execution horizon typically use an intraday benchmark, such as VWAP or TWAP. Managers of index funds or funds whose valuation is calculated using closing prices typically select the closing price post-trade benchmark to minimize fund risk and tracking error. The primary goal of a trading strategy is to balance the expected costs, risks, and alpha associated with trading the order in a manner consistent with the portfolio managers trading objectives, risk aversion, and other known constraints. Execution algorithms can be classified into the following types: scheduled, liquidity seeking, arrival price, dark aggregators, and smart order routers. Equities are traded on exchanges and other multilateral trading venues. Algorithmic trading is common, and most trades are electronic, except for very large trades and trades in illiquid securities. Fixed-income securities are generally traded not on exchanges but in a bilateral, dealer-centric market structure where dealers make markets in the securities. The majority of fixed-income securities are relatively illiquid, especially if they have been issued in prior periods, so-called off-the-run bonds. Most of the trading volume in exchange-traded derivatives is concentrated in futures. Electronic trading is pervasive, and algorithmic trading is growing. OTC derivative markets have historically been opaque, with little public data about prices, trade sizes, and structure details. In recent years, regulators have been placing pressure on OTC markets to introduce central clearing facilities and to display trades publicly in an attempt to increase contract standardization and price discovery and reduce counterparty risk. There is no exchange or centralized clearing place for the majority of spot currency trades. Spot currency markets consist of a number of electronic venues and broker markets. The currency market is entirely an OTC market. The implementation shortfall measure is the standard for measuring the total cost of the trade. IS compares a portfolios actual return with its paper return (where transactions are based on decision price). The IS attribution decomposes total trade cost into its delay, execution, and opportunity cost components. Delay cost is the cost associated with not submitting the order to the market at the time of the portfolio managers investment decision. Execution cost is the cost due to the buying and/or selling pressure of the portfolio manager and corresponding market risk. Opportunity cost is the cost due to not being able to execute all shares of the order because of adverse price movement or insufficient liquidity. Trade evaluation measures the execution quality of the trade and the performance of the trader, broker, and/or algorithm used. Various techniques measure trade cost execution using different benchmarks (pre-trade, intraday, and post-trade). Trade cost analysis enables investors to better manage trading costs and understand where trading activities can be improved through the use of appropriate trading partners and venues. Major regulators mandate that asset managers have in place a trade policy document that clearly and comprehensively articulates a firms trading policies and escalation procedures. The objective of a trade policy is to ensure the asset managers execution and order-handling procedures are in line with their fiduciary duty owed to clients for best execution. A trade policy document needs to incorporate the following key aspects: meaning of best execution, factors determining the optimal order execution approach, handling trading errors, listing of eligible brokers and execution venues, and a process to monitor execution arrangements.",Trade Strategy and Execution,2024
"Risk management for individuals is a key element of life-cycle finance, which recognizes that as investors age, the fundamental nature of their total wealth evolves, as do the risks that they face. Life-cycle finance is concerned with helping investors achieve their goals, including an adequate retirement income, by taking a holistic view of the individuals financial situation as he or she moves through life. Individuals are exposed to a range of risks over their lives: They may become disabled, suffer a prolonged illness, die prematurely, or outlive their resources. In addition, from an investment perspective, the assets of individuals could decline in value or provide an inadequate return in relation to financial needs and aspirations. All of these risks have two things in common: They are typically random, and they can result in financial hardship without an appropriate risk management strategy. Risk management for individuals is distinct from risk management for corporations given the distinctive characteristics of households, which include the finite and unknown lifespan of individuals, the frequent preference for stable spending among individuals, and the desire to pass on wealth to heirs (i.e., through bequests). To protect against unexpected financial hardships, risks must be identified, market and non-market solutions considered, and a plan developed and implemented. A well-constructed plan for risk management will involve the selection of financial products and investment strategies that fit an individuals financial goals and mitigate the risk of shortfalls. In this reading, we provide an overview of the potential risks to an individual or household, an analysis of products and strategies that can protect against some of these risks, and a discussion regarding the selection of an appropriate product or strategy. Following the introduction, Section 2 provides an overview of human and financial capital. Section 3 addresses the process of risk management, the financial stages of life for an individual, the economic (or holistic) balance sheet, and individual risks and risk exposures. Section 4 discusses the types of products relevant to financial planning, including insurance and annuities. Section 5 contains an insurance program case study and insights on implementing risk management solutions for individuals. Section 6 summarizes the key points of the reading.","The member should be able to: compare the characteristics of human capital and financial capital as components of an individuals total wealth; discuss the relationships among human capital, financial capital, and economic net worth; discuss the financial stages of life for an individual; describe an economic (holistic) balance sheet; discuss risks (earnings, premature death, longevity, property, liability, and health risks) in relation to human and financial capital; describe types of insurance relevant to personal financial planning; describe the basic elements of a life insurance policy and how insurers price a life insurance policy; discuss the use of annuities in personal financial planning; discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of fixed and variable annuities; analyze and critique an insurance program; discuss how asset allocation policy may be influenced by the risk characteristics of human capital; recommend and justify appropriate strategies for asset allocation and risk reduction when given an investor profile of key inputs.",Level III,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V4R5_risk_management_for_individuals.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/risk-management-individuals,"The risk management process for individuals is complex given the variety of potential risks that may be experienced over the life cycle and the differences that exist across households. In this reading, key concepts related to risk management and individuals include the following: The two primary asset types for most individuals can be described broadly as human capital and financial capital. Human capital is the net present value of the individuals future expected labor income, whereas financial capital consists of assets currently owned by the individual and can include such items as a bank account, individual securities, pooled funds, a retirement account, and a home. Economic net worth is an extension of traditional balance sheet net worth that includes claims to future assets that can be used for consumption, such as human capital, as well as the present value of pension benefits. There are typically four key steps in the risk management process for individuals: Specify the objective, identify risks, evaluate risks and select appropriate methods to manage the risks, and monitor outcomes and risk exposures and make appropriate adjustments in methods. The financial stages of life for adults can be categorized in the following seven periods: education phase, early career, career development, peak accumulation, pre-retirement, early retirement, and late retirement. The primary goal of an economic (holistic) balance sheet is to arrive at an accurate depiction of an individuals overall financial health by accounting for the present value of all available marketable and non-marketable assets, as well as all liabilities. An economic (holistic) balance sheet includes traditional assets and liabilities, as well as human capital and pension value, as assets and includes consumption and bequests as liabilities. The total economic wealth of an individual changes throughout his or her lifetime, as do the underlying assets that make up that wealth. The total economic wealth of younger individuals is typically dominated by the value of their human capital. As individuals age, earnings will accumulate, increasing financial capital. Earnings risk refers to the risks associated with the earnings potential of an individual—that is, events that could negatively affect someones human and financial capital. Premature death risk relates to the death of an individual, such as a family member, whose future earnings (human capital) were expected to help pay for the financial needs and aspirations of the family. Longevity risk is the risk of reaching an age at which ones income and financial assets are insufficient to provide adequate support. Property risk relates to the possibility that ones property may be damaged, destroyed, stolen, or lost. There are different types of property insurance, depending on the asset, such as automobile insurance and homeowners insurance. Liability risk refers to the possibility that an individual or other entity may be held legally liable for the financial costs of property damage or physical injury. Health risk refers to the risks and implications associated with illness or injury. Health risks manifest themselves in different ways over the life cycle and can have significant implications for human capital. The primary purpose of life insurance is to help replace the economic value of an individual to a family or a business in the event of that individuals death. The familys need for life insurance is related to the potential loss associated with the future earnings power of that individual. The two main types of life insurance are temporary and permanent. Temporary life insurance, or term life insurance, provides insurance for a certain period of time specified at purchase, whereas permanent insurance, or whole life insurance, is used to provide lifetime coverage, assuming the premiums are paid over the entire period. Fixed annuities provide a benefit that is fixed (or known) for life, whereas variable annuities have a benefit that can change over time and that is generally based on the performance of some underlying portfolio or investment. When selecting between fixed and variable annuities, there are a number of important considerations, such as the volatility of the benefit, flexibility, future market expectations, fees, and inflation concerns. Among the factors that would likely increase demand for an annuity are the following: longer-than-average life expectancy, greater preference for lifetime income, less concern for leaving money to heirs, more conservative investing preferences, and lower guaranteed income from other sources (such as pensions). Techniques for managing a risk include risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk transfer, and risk retention. The most appropriate choice among these techniques often is related to consideration of the frequency and severity of losses associated with the risk. The decision to retain risk or buy insurance is determined by a households risk tolerance. At the same level of wealth, a more risk-tolerant household will prefer to retain more risk, either through higher insurance deductibles or by simply not buying insurance, than will a less risk-tolerant household. Insurance products that have a higher load will encourage a household to retain more risk. An individuals total economic wealth affects portfolio construction through asset allocation, which includes the overall allocation to risky assets, as well as the underlying asset classes, such as stocks and bonds, selected by the individual. Investment risk, property risk, and human capital risk can be either idiosyncratic or systematic. Examples of idiosyncratic risks include the risks of a specific occupation, the risk of living a very long life or experiencing a long-term illness, and the risk of premature death or loss of property. Systematic risks affect all households.",Risk Management for Individuals,2024
"Private wealth management refers to investment management and financial planning for individual investors. The private wealth sector has grown considerably as global wealth has increased and as individuals have taken on more of the responsibility for managing their own financial resources. Private wealth managers can help individual investors seek the benefits as well as navigate the complexities of financial markets. This reading introduces candidates to the process of designing and executing an investment plan or strategy for the individual investor. We discuss the tools and techniques used by private wealth managers and how the wealth manager interacts with the client to serve the clients needs. Section 2 examines the key differences between private clients and institutional clients. In Section 3, we discuss how the wealth manager gains an understanding of the client and identifies key attributes of the clients financial situation that are relevant to the wealth management process. Section 4 covers investment planning, including capital sufficiency and retirement planning. Section 5 discusses the investment policy statement, including its various underlying parts. Section 6 analyzes portfolio construction, portfolio reporting, and portfolio review. Finally, in Section 7, we discuss the practice of private wealth management, including ethical considerations for private wealth managers, compliance considerations, and the various client segments that private wealth managers encounter. Reflecting the variation in industry terms, we use the terms private wealth managers, wealth managers, and advisors interchangeably. We also refer to individual investors as private clients or, simply, clients. In practice, private wealth managers typically operate either independently or as representatives of organizations, such as wealth management firms, banks, and broker/dealers.",The member should be able to: contrast private client and institutional client investment concerns; discuss information needed in advising private clients; identify tax considerations affecting a private clients investments; identify and formulate client goals based on client information; evaluate a private clients risk tolerance; describe technical and soft skills needed in advising private clients; evaluate capital sufficiency in relation to client goals; discuss the principles of retirement planning; discuss the parts of an investment policy statement (IPS) for a private client; prepare the investment objectives section of an IPS for a private client; evaluate and recommend improvements to an IPS for a private client; recommend and justify portfolio allocations and investments for a private client; describe effective practices in portfolio reporting and review; evaluate the success of an investment program for a private client; discuss ethical and compliance considerations in advising private clients; discuss how levels of service and range of solutions are related to different private clients.,Level III,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V4R3_private_wealth_management.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/overview-private-wealth-management,"Private clients and institutional clients have different concerns, primarily relating to investment objectives and constraints, investment governance, investment sophistication, regulation, and the uniqueness of individuals. Information needed in advising private clients includes personal information, financial information, and tax considerations. Basic tax strategies for private clients include tax avoidance, tax reduction, and tax deferral. A clients planned goals are those that can be reasonably estimated or quantified within an expected time horizon, such as retirement, specific purchases, education, family events, wealth transfer, and philanthropy. Unplanned goals are those related to unforeseen financial needs, such as property repairs and medical expenses. When establishing client goals, private wealth managers consider goal quantification, goal prioritization, and goal changes. Risk tolerance refers to the level of risk an individual is willing and able to bear. Risk tolerance is the inverse of risk aversion. Risk capacity is the ability to accept financial risk. Risk perception is an individuals subjective assessment of the risk involved in an investment decisions outcome. Wealth managers often utilize questionnaires to assess clients risk tolerance. The result of a risk tolerance questionnaire, typically a numerical score, is often used as an input in the investment planning process. Wealth managers need both technical skills and non-technical (soft) skills in their advisory roles. Technical skills include capital markets proficiency, portfolio construction ability, financial planning knowledge, quantitative skills, technology skills, and in some situations, foreign language fluency. Soft skills include communication skills, social skills, education/coaching skills, and business development and sales skills. Capital sufficiency analysis, also known as capital needs analysis, is the process by which a wealth manager determines whether a client has, or is likely to accumulate, sufficient financial resources to meet his or her objectives. Two methods for evaluating capital sufficiency are deterministic forecasting and Monte Carlo simulation. Wealth managers use several different methods to analyze a clients retirement goals, including mortality tables, annuities, and Monte Carlo simulation. An investment policy statement (IPS) for an individual includes the following parts: background and investment objective(s); investment parameters (risk tolerance and investment time horizon); asset class preferences; other investment preferences (liquidity and constraints); portfolio asset allocation; portfolio management (discretionary authority, rebalancing, tactical changes, implementation); duties and responsibilities; and an appendix for additional details. Two primary approaches to constructing a client portfolio are a traditional approach and a goals-based investing approach. Portfolio reporting involves periodically providing clients with information about their investment portfolio and performance. Portfolio review refers to meetings or phone conversations between a wealth manager and a client to discuss the clients investment strategy. The key difference between portfolio reporting and portfolio review is that the wealth manager is more actively engaged in a review. The success of an investment program involves achieving client goals, following a consistent process, and realizing favorable portfolio performance. Ethical considerations for private wealth managers include know your customer (KYC), fiduciary duty and suitability, confidentiality, and conflicts of interest. Several global regulations have relevance for private wealth managers. Key private wealth segments include mass affluent, high net worth, and ultra high net worth. Robo-advisors have emerged in the mass affluent client segment. These advisors have a primarily digital client interface. Robo-advisor service providers generally charge lower fees than traditional wealth management firms. Scalability of technology has enabled robo-advisors to service investors with relatively small portfolios.",Overview of Private Wealth Management,2024
"Risk—and risk management—is an inescapable part of economic activity. People generally manage their affairs to be as happy and secure as their environment and resources will allow. But regardless of how carefully these affairs are managed, there is risk because the outcome, whether good or bad, is seldom predictable with complete certainty. There is risk inherent in nearly everything we do, but this reading will focus on economic and financial risk, particularly as it relates to investment management. All businesses and investors manage risk, whether consciously or not, in the choices they make. At its core, business and investing are about allocating resources and capital to chosen risks. In their decision process, within an environment of uncertainty, these organizations may take steps to avoid some risks, pursue the risks that provide the highest rewards, and measure and mitigate their exposure to these risks as necessary. Risk management processes and tools make difficult business and financial problems easier to address in an uncertain world. Risk is not just a matter of fate; it is something that organizations can actively manage with their decisions, within a risk management framework. Risk is an integral part of the business or investment process. Even in the earliest models of modern portfolio theory, such as mean–variance portfolio optimization and the capital asset pricing model, investment return is linked directly to risk but requires that risk be managed optimally. Proper identification and measurement of risk, and keeping risks aligned with the goals of the enterprise, are key factors in managing businesses and investments. Good risk management results in a higher chance of a preferred outcome—more value for the company or portfolio or more utility for the individual. Portfolio managers need to be familiar with risk management not only to improve the portfolios risk–return outcome, but also because of two other ways in which they use risk management at an enterprise level. First, they help to manage their own companies that have their own enterprise risk issues. Second, many portfolio assets are claims on companies that have risks. Portfolio managers need to evaluate the companies risks and how those companies are addressing them. This reading takes a broad approach that addresses both the risk management of enterprises in general and portfolio risk management. The principles underlying portfolio risk management are generally applicable to the risk management of financial and non-financial institutions as well. The concept of risk management is also relevant to individuals. Although many large organizations formally practice risk management, most individuals practice it more informally and some practice it haphazardly, oftentimes responding to risk events after they occur. Although many individuals do take reasonable precautions against unwanted risks, these precautions are often against obvious risks. The more subtle risks are often ignored. Unfortunately, many individuals do not view risk management as a formal, systematic process that would help them achieve not only their financial goals but also the ultimate goal, or maximum utility as economists like to call it, but they should. Although the primary focus of this reading is on institutions, we will also cover risk management as it applies to individuals. We will show that many common themes underlie risk management—themes that are applicable to both organizations and individuals. Although often viewed as defensive, risk management is a valuable offensive weapon in the managers arsenal. In the quest for preferred outcomes, such as higher profit, returns, or share price, management does not usually get to choose the outcomes but does choose the risks it takes in pursuit of those outcomes. The choice of which risks to undertake through the allocation of its scarce resources is the key tool available to management. An organization with a comprehensive risk management culture in place, in which risk is integral to every key strategy and decision, should perform better in the long-term, in good times and bad, as a result of better decision making. The fact that all businesses and investors engage in risky activities (i.e., activities with uncertain outcomes) raises a number of important questions. The questions that this reading will address include the following: What is risk management, and why is it important? What risks does an organization (or individual) face in pursuing its objectives? How are an organizations goals affected by risk, and how does it make risk management decisions to produce better results? How does risk governance guide the risk management process and risk budgeting to integrate an organizations goals with its activities? How does an organization measure and evaluate the risks it faces, and what tools does it have to address these risks? The answers to these questions collectively help to define the process of risk management. This reading is organized along the lines of these questions. Section 2 describes the risk management process, and Section 3 discusses risk governance and risk tolerance. Section 4 covers the identification of various risks, and Section 5 addresses the measurement and management of risks. Section 6 provides a summary.",The member should be able to: define risk management; describe features of a risk management framework; define risk governance and describe elements of effective risk governance; explain how risk tolerance affects risk management; describe risk budgeting and its role in risk governance; identify financial and non-financial sources of risk and describe how they may interact; describe methods for measuring and modifying risk exposures and factors to consider in choosing among the methods.,Level I,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level1a/RR_2024_L1V6R4_intro_risk_management.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/introduction-risk-management,"Success in business and investing requires the skillful selection and management of risks. A well-developed risk management process ties together an organizations goals, strategic competencies, and tools to create value to help it both thrive and survive. Good risk management results in better decision making and a keener assessment of the many important trade-offs in business and investing, helping managers maximize value.Risk and risk management are critical to good business and investing. Risk management is not only about avoiding risk.Taking risk is an active choice by boards and management, investment managers, and individuals. Risks must be understood and carefully chosen and managed.Risk exposure is the extent to which an organizations value may be affected through sensitivity to underlying risks.Risk management is a process that defines risk tolerance and measures, monitors, and modifies risks to be in line with that tolerance.A risk management framework is the infrastructure, processes, and analytics needed to support effective risk management; it includes risk governance, risk identification and measurement, risk infrastructure, risk policies and processes, risk mitigation and management, communication, and strategic risk analysis and integration.Risk governance is the top-level foundation for risk management, including risk oversight and setting risk tolerance for the organization.Risk identification and measurement is the quantitative and qualitative assessment of all potential sources of risk and the organizations risk exposures.Risk infrastructure comprises the resources and systems required to track and assess the organizations risk profile.Risk policies and processes are managements complement to risk governance at the operating level.Risk mitigation and management is the active monitoring and adjusting of risk exposures, integrating all the other factors of the risk management framework.Communication includes risk reporting and active feedback loops so that the risk process improves decision making.Strategic risk analysis and integration involves using these risk tools to rigorously sort out the factors that are and are not adding value as well as incorporating this analysis into the management decision process, with the intent of improving outcomes.Employing a risk management committee, along with a chief risk officer (CRO), are hallmarks of a strong risk governance framework. Governance and the entire risk process should take an enterprise risk management perspective to ensure that the value of the entire enterprise is maximized.Risk tolerance, a key element of good risk governance, delineates which risks are acceptable, which are unacceptable, and how much risk the overall organization can be exposed to.Risk budgeting is any means of allocating investments or assets by their risk characteristics.Financial risks are those that arise from activity in the financial markets.Non-financial risks arise from actions within an organization or from external origins, such as the environment, the community, regulators, politicians, suppliers, and customers.Financial risks consist of market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.Market risk arises from movements in stock prices, interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices.Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not pay an amount owed.Liquidity risk is the risk that, as a result of degradation in market conditions or the lack of market participants, one will be unable to sell an asset without lowering the price to less than the fundamental value.Non-financial risks consist of a variety of risks, including settlement risk, legal risk, regulatory risk, accounting risk, tax risk, model risk, tail risk, and operational risk.Operational risk is the risk that arises either from within the operations of an organization or from external events that are beyond the control of the organization but affect its operations. Operational risk can be caused by employees, the weather and natural disasters, vulnerabilities of IT systems, or terrorism.Solvency risk is the risk that the organization does not survive or succeed because it runs out of cash to meet its financial obligations.Individuals face many of the same organizational risks outlined here but also face health risk, mortality or longevity risk, and property and casualty risk.Risks are not necessarily independent because many risks arise as a result of other risks; risk interactions can be extremely non-linear and harmful.Risk drivers are the fundamental global and domestic macroeconomic and industry factors that create risk.Common measures of risk include standard deviation or volatility; asset-specific measures, such as beta or duration; derivative measures, such as delta, gamma, vega, and rho; and tail measures such as value at risk, CVaR and expected loss given default.Risk can be modified by prevention and avoidance, risk transfer (insurance), or risk shifting (derivatives). Risk can be mitigated internally through self-insurance or diversification. The primary determinants of which method is best for modifying risk are the benefits weighed against the costs, with consideration for the overall final risk profile and adherence to risk governance objectives.",Introduction to Risk Management,2024
"Institutional investors are corporations, trusts, or other legal entities that invest in financial markets on behalf of groups or individuals, including both current and future generations. On a global basis, institutional investors represent more than US$70 trillion in investable assets, and, as such, wield significant influence over capital markets. The universe of institutional investors includes, but is not limited to, defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, banks, and insurance companies. Pension plans, which account for approximately US$35 trillion in investable assets or roughly half of global institutional assets under management, include both defined benefit plans, in which the sponsor (employer) assumes investment risk, and defined contribution plans, in which the individual makes investment decisions and assumes the investment risk. Sovereign wealth funds, which account for about US$7 trillion in assets as of the end of 2016, are government-owned investment funds that invest in financial and/or real assets. Endowments and foundations, which account for approximately US$1.6 trillion in assets, manage assets on behalf of educational institutions, hospitals, churches, museums, and other charitable organizations. Banks and insurance companies, comprising net financial assets on the order of US$9 trillion, are financial intermediaries that balance portfolios of securities, loans, and derivatives for the purposes of (i) meeting the claims of depositors, counterparties, policyholders, and creditors and (ii) providing adequate returns to their contractual capital holders. The universe of institutional investors is comprised of large, complex, and sophisticated investors that must contend with a multitude of investment challenges and constraints. There has been an important shift in the asset allocation of institutional investors over the last half century. In the 1970s, most pensions and endowments invested almost exclusively in domestic, fixed-income instruments. In the 1980s, many institutional investors began to invest in equity markets and often pursued a long-term strategic allocation of 60% equities/40% fixed income. In the 1990s, investors recognized the benefits of diversification and many made their first forays into international equity markets. At the turn of the 21st century, many of the worlds largest pension funds and endowments further diversified their portfolios and increased investments in alternative asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds, real estate, and other alternative or illiquid assets. Meanwhile, institutional investors have seen broad shifts in their strategic investment behavior. The trend toward Liability Driven Investing (LDI), long a mainstay of banks and insurance companies, has taken hold among many defined benefit pension plans, particularly US corporate and public pension funds. Sovereign wealth funds have amassed significant assets over the past several decades, and many have implemented innovative investment approaches characterized by active management. Many endowments have adopted the Endowment Model of investing that involves significant exposure to alternative investments. Meanwhile, banks and insurers must navigate a complex and ever-changing economic and regulatory environment. In this reading, we endeavor to put the numerous factors that affect investment by institutional investors into context. Section 2 discusses common characteristics of institutional investors as a group. Section 3 provides an overview of investment policies for institutional investors. Detailed coverage by institutional investor type begins with Section 4, pension funds, where we discuss various factors that influence investments, including: stakeholders, liability streams, investment horizons, and liquidity needs; major legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax constraints; investment objectives and key components of Investment Policy Statements; and, finally, asset allocation and investment portfolios that emanate from the foregoing factors and constraints. Section 5 follows the same approach for sovereign wealth funds, and Section 6 does the same for university endowments and private foundations. Section 7 covers banks and insurers and includes balance sheet management considerations. A summary of key points concludes the reading.","The member should be able to: discuss common characteristics of institutional investors as a group; discuss investment policy of institutional investors; discuss the stakeholders in the portfolio, the liabilities, the investment time horizons, and the liquidity needs of different types of institutional investors; describe the focus of legal, regulatory, and tax constraints affecting different types of institutional investors; evaluate risk considerations of private defined benefit (DB) pension plans in relation to 1) plan funded status, 2) sponsor financial strength, 3) interactions between the sponsors business and the funds investments, 4) plan design, and 5) workforce characteristics; prepare the investment objectives section of an institutional investors investment policy statement; evaluate the investment policy statement of an institutional investor; evaluate the investment portfolio of a private DB plan, sovereign wealth fund, university endowment, and private foundation; describe considerations affecting the balance sheet management of banks and insurers.",Level III,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V5R1_portfolio_management_for_institutional_investors.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/portfolio-management-institutional-investors,"This reading has introduced the subject of managing institutional investor portfolios. The key points made in this reading are as follows: The main institutional investor types are pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, banks, and insurance companies. Common characteristics among these investors include a large scale (i.e., asset size), a long-term investment horizon, regulatory constraints, a clearly defined governance framework, and principal–agent issues. Institutional investors typically codify their mission, investment objectives, and guidelines in an Investment Policy Statement (IPS). Four common investment approaches to managing portfolios used by institutional investors are the Norway model, the Endowment model, the Canada model, and the Liability Driven Investing (LDI) model. There are two main types of pension plans: defined benefit (DB), in which a plan sponsor commits to paying a specified retirement benefit; and defined contribution (DC), in which contributions are defined but the ultimate retirement benefit is not specified or guaranteed by the plan sponsor. Pension plan stakeholders include the employer, employees, retirees, unions, management, the investment committee and/or board of directors, and shareholders. The key elements in the calculation of DB plan liabilities are as follows: Service/tenure: The higher the service years, the higher the retirement benefit. Salary/earnings: The higher the salary over the measurement period, the higher the retirement benefit. Mortality/longevity: The longer the participants expected life span, the higher the plan sponsors liability. Vesting: Lower turnover results in higher vesting, increasing the plan sponsors liabilities. Discount rate: A higher discount rate reduces the present value of the plan sponsors liabilities. DB plan liquidity needs are driven by the following: Proportion of active employees relative to retirees: More mature pension funds have higher liquidity needs. Age of workforce: Liquidity needs rise as the age of the workforce increases. Plan funded status: If the plan is well funded, the sponsor may reduce contributions, generating a need to hold higher balances of liquid assets to pay benefits. Flexibility: Ability of participants to switch among the sponsors plans or to withdraw from the plan. Pension plans are subject to significant and evolving regulatory constraints designed to ensure the integrity, adequacy, and sustainability of the pension system. Some incentives, such as tax exemption, are only granted to plans that meet these regulatory requirements. Notable differences in legal, regulatory, and tax considerations can lead to differences in plan design from one country to another or from one group to another (e.g., public plans vs. corporate plans). The following risk considerations affect the way DB plans are managed: Plan funded status Sponsor financial strength Interactions between the sponsors business and the funds investments Plan design Workforce characteristics An examination of pension fund asset allocations shows very large differences in average asset allocations by country and within a country despite these plans seeking to achieve similar goals. Such inter- and intra-national differences are driven by many factors, including the differences in legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax constraints; the investment objectives, risk appetites, and investment views of the stakeholders; the liabilities to and demographics of the ultimate beneficiaries; the availability of suitable investment opportunities; and the expected cost of living in retirement. The major types of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) follow: Budget Stabilization funds: Set up to insulate the budget and economy from commodity price volatility and external shocks. Development funds: Established to allocate resources to priority socioeconomic projects, usually infrastructure. Savings funds: Intended to share wealth across generations by transforming non-renewable assets into diversified financial assets. Reserve funds: Intended to reduce the negative carry costs of holding foreign currency reserves or to earn higher return on ample reserves. Pension Reserve funds: Set up to meet identified future outflows with respect to pension-related, contingent-type liabilities on governments balance sheets. Stakeholders of SWFs include the countrys citizens, the government, external asset managers, and the SWFs management, investment committee and board of directors. Given their mission of intergenerational wealth transfer, SWFs do not generally have clearly defined liabilities, so do not typically pursue asset/liability matching strategies used by other institutional investor types. Sovereign wealth funds have differing liquidity needs. Budget stabilization funds require the most liquidity, followed by reserve funds. At the other end of the spectrum are savings funds with low liquidity needs, followed by pension reserve funds. The investment objectives of SWFs are often clearly articulated in the legislative instruments that create them. They are often tax free in their home country, though must take foreign taxation into consideration. Given their significant asset sizes and the nature of their stakeholders, SWFs have aimed to increase transparency regarding their investment activities. In this regard, the Santiago Principles are a form of self-regulation. The typical asset allocation by SWF type shows budget stabilization funds are invested mainly in bonds and cash given their liquidity needs. Reserve Funds invest in equities and alternatives but maintain a significant allocation of bonds for liquidity. Savings funds and pension reserve funds hold relatively higher allocations of equities and alternatives because of their longer-term liabilities. Endowments and foundations typically invest to maintain purchasing power while financing their supporting university (endowments) or making grants (foundations) in perpetuity—based on the notion of intergenerational equity. Endowments and foundations usually have a formal spending policy that determines how much is paid out annually to support their mission. This future stream of payouts represents their liabilities. For endowments, other liability-related factors to be considered when setting investment policy are: 1) the ability to raise additional funds from donors/alumni, 2) the percentage of the universitys operating budget provided by the endowment, and 3) the ability to issue debt. Foundations and endowments typically enjoy tax-exempt status and face relatively little regulation compared to other types of institutional investors. Foundations face less flexible spending rules compared to endowments; foundations in the US are legally mandated to pay out 5% of their assets annually to maintain tax-exempt status. Endowments and foundations have relatively low liquidity needs. However, foundations have somewhat higher liquidity needs (vs. endowments), because they 1) typically pay out slightly more as a percentage of assets, and 2) finance the entire operating budget of the organization they support. Endowments and foundations typically have a long-term real return objective of about 5% consistent with their spending policies. This real return objective, and a desire to maintain purchasing power, results in endowments and foundations making significant allocations to real assets. In general, endowments and foundations invest heavily in private asset classes and hedge funds and have relatively small allocations to fixed income. Banking and insurance companies manage both portfolio assets and institutional liabilities to achieve an extremely high probability that obligations on deposits, guarantees, derivatives, policyholder claims, and other liabilities will be paid in full and on time. Banking and insurance companies have perpetual time horizons. Strategically, their goal is to maximize net present value to capital holders; tactically, this may be achieved by liability driven investing (LDI) over intermediate and shorter horizons. Financial institutions are highly regulated because of their importance to the non-financial, or real, sectors of the economy. Such institutions are also regulated in order to minimize contagion risk rippling throughout the financial and real sectors. The underlying premise of regulation is that an institutions capital must be adequate to absorb shocks to both asset and liability values. This implies limiting the volatility of value of the institutions shareholder capital. The volatility of shareholder capital can be managed by (a) reducing the price volatility of portfolio investments, loans, and derivatives; (b) lowering the volatility from unexpected shocks to claims, deposits, guarantees, and other liabilities; (c) limiting leverage; and (d) attempting to achieve positive correlation between changes in the value of assets and liabilities. Ample liquidity, diversification of portfolio and other assets, high investment quality, transparency, stable funding, duration management, diversification of insurance underwriting risks, and monetary limits on guarantees, funding commitments, and insurance claims are some of the ways management and regulators attempt to achieve low volatility of shareholder capital value.",Portfolio Management for Institutional Investors,2024
"This reading is an introduction to the process of measuring and managing market risk. Market risk is the risk that arises from movements in stock prices, interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices. Market risk is distinguished from credit risk, which is the risk of loss from the failure of a counterparty to make a promised payment, and also from a number of other risks that organizations face, such as breakdowns in their operational procedures. In essence, market risk is the risk arising from changes in the markets to which an organization has exposure. Risk management is the process of identifying and measuring risk and ensuring that the risks being taken are consistent with the desired risks. The process of managing market risk relies heavily on the use of models. A model is a simplified representation of a real world phenomenon. Financial models attempt to capture the important elements that determine prices and sensitivities in financial markets. In doing so, they provide critical information necessary to manage investment risk. For example, investment risk models help a portfolio manager understand how much the value of the portfolio is likely to change given a change in a certain risk factor. They also provide insight into the gains and losses the portfolio might reasonably be expected to experience and the frequency with which large losses might occur. Effective risk management, though, is much more than just applying financial models. It requires the application of judgment and experience not only to know how to use the models appropriately but also to appreciate the strengths and limitations of the models and to know when to supplement or substitute one model with another model or approach. Financial markets operate more or less continuously, and new prices are constantly being generated. As a result, there is a large amount of data on market risk and a lot of collective experience dealing with this risk, making market risk one of the easier financial risks to analyze. Still, market risk is not an easy risk to capture. Although a portfolios exposures can be identified with some certainty, the potential losses that could arise from those exposures are unknown. The data used to estimate potential losses are generated from past prices and rates, not the ones to come. Risk management models allow the experienced risk manager to blend that historical data with their own forward-looking judgment, providing a framework within which to test that judgment. We first lay a foundation for understanding value at risk, discuss three primary approaches to estimating value at risk, and cover the primary advantages and limitations as well as extensions of value at risk. We then address the sensitivity measures used for equities, fixed-income securities, and options and also cover historical and hypothetical scenario risk measures. Next, we discuss the use of constraints in risk management, such as risk budgeting, position limits, scenario limits, stop-loss limits, and capital allocation as risk management tools. Lastly, we describe various applications and limitations of risk measures as used by different types of market participants and summarize our discussion.","The member should be able to: explain the use of value at risk (VaR) in measuring portfolio risk; compare the parametric (variance–covariance), historical simulation, and Monte Carlo simulation methods for estimating VaR; estimate and interpret VaR under the parametric, historical simulation, and Monte Carlo simulation methods; describe advantages and limitations of VaR; describe extensions of VaR; describe sensitivity risk measures and scenario risk measures and compare these measures to VaR; demonstrate how equity, fixed-income, and options exposure measures may be used in measuring and managing market risk and volatility risk; describe the use of sensitivity risk measures and scenario risk measures; describe advantages and limitations of sensitivity risk measures and scenario risk measures; explain constraints used in managing market risks, including risk budgeting, position limits, scenario limits, and stop-loss limits; explain how risk measures may be used in capital allocation decisions; describe risk measures used by banks, asset managers, pension funds, and insurers.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V5R9_measuring_managing_market_risk.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/measuring-managing-market-risk,"This reading on market risk management models covers various techniques used to manage the risk arising from market fluctuations in prices and rates. The key points are summarized as follows: Value at risk (VaR) is the minimum loss in either currency units or as a percentage of portfolio value that would be expected to be incurred a certain percentage of the time over a certain period of time given assumed market conditions. VaR requires the decomposition of portfolio performance into risk factors. The three methods of estimating VaR are the parametric method, the historical simulation method, and the Monte Carlo simulation method. The parametric method of VaR estimation typically provides a VaR estimate from the left tail of a normal distribution, incorporating the expected returns, variances, and covariances of the components of the portfolio. The parametric method exploits the simplicity of the normal distribution but provides a poor estimate of VaR when returns are not normally distributed, as might occur when a portfolio contains options. The historical simulation method of VaR estimation uses historical return data on the portfolios current holdings and allocation. The historical simulation method has the advantage of incorporating events that actually occurred and does not require the specification of a distribution or the estimation of parameters, but it is only useful to the extent that the future resembles the past. The Monte Carlo simulation method of VaR estimation requires the specification of a statistical distribution of returns and the generation of random outcomes from that distribution. The Monte Carlo simulation method is extremely flexible but can be complex and time consuming to use. There is no single right way to estimate VaR. The advantages of VaR include the following: It is a simple concept; it is relatively easy to understand and easily communicated, capturing much information in a single number. It can be useful in comparing risks across asset classes, portfolios, and trading units and, as such, facilitates capital allocation decisions. It can be used for performance evaluation and can be verified by using backtesting. It is widely accepted by regulators. The primary limitations of VaR are that it is a subjective measure and highly sensitive to numerous discretionary choices made in the course of computation. It can underestimate the frequency of extreme events. It fails to account for the lack of liquidity and is sensitive to correlation risk. It is vulnerable to trending or volatility regimes and is often misunderstood as a worst-case scenario. It can oversimplify the picture of risk and focuses heavily on the left tail. There are numerous variations and extensions of VaR, including conditional VaR (CVaR), incremental VaR (IVaR), and marginal VaR (MVaR), that can provide additional useful information. Conditional VaR is the average loss conditional on exceeding the VaR cutoff. Incremental VaR measures the change in portfolio VaR as a result of adding or deleting a position from the portfolio or if a position size is changed relative to the remaining positions. MVaR measures the change in portfolio VaR given a small change in the portfolio position. In a diversified portfolio, MVaRs can be summed to determine the contribution of each asset to the overall VaR. Ex ante tracking error measures the degree to which the performance of a given investment portfolio might deviate from its benchmark. Sensitivity measures quantify how a security or portfolio will react if a single risk factor changes. Common sensitivity measures are beta for equities; duration and convexity for bonds; and delta, gamma, and vega for options. Sensitivity measures do not indicate which portfolio has greater loss potential. Risk managers can use deltas, gammas, vegas, durations, convexities, and betas to get a comprehensive picture of the sensitivity of the entire portfolio. Stress tests apply extreme negative stress to a particular portfolio exposure. Scenario measures, including stress tests, are risk models that evaluate how a portfolio will perform under certain high-stress market conditions. Scenario measures can be based on actual historical scenarios or on hypothetical scenarios. Historical scenarios are scenarios that measure the portfolio return that would result from a repeat of a particular period of financial market history. Hypothetical scenarios model the impact of extreme movements and co-movements in different markets that have not previously occurred. Reverse stress testing is the process of stressing the portfolios most significant exposures. Sensitivity and scenario risk measures can complement VaR. They do not need to rely on history, and scenarios can be designed to overcome an assumption of normal distributions. Limitations of scenario measures include the following: Historical scenarios are unlikely to re-occur in exactly the same way. Hypothetical scenarios may incorrectly specify how assets will co-move and thus may get the magnitude of movements wrong. And, it is difficult to establish appropriate limits on a scenario analysis or stress test. Constraints are widely used in risk management in the form of risk budgets, position limits, scenario limits, stop-loss limits, and capital allocation. Risk budgeting is the allocation of the total risk appetite across sub-portfolios. A scenario limit is a limit on the estimated loss for a given scenario, which, if exceeded, would require corrective action in the portfolio. A stop-loss limit either requires a reduction in the size of a portfolio or its complete liquidation (when a loss of a particular size occurs in a specified period). Position limits are limits on the market value of any given investment. Risk measurements and constraints in and of themselves are not restrictive or unrestrictive; it is the limits placed on the measures that drive action. The degree of leverage, the mix of risk factors to which the business is exposed, and accounting or regulatory requirements influence the types of risk measures used by different market participants. Banks use risk tools to assess the extent of any liquidity and asset/liability mismatch, the probability of losses in their investment portfolios, their overall leverage ratio, interest rate sensitivities, and the risk to economic capital. Asset managers use of risk tools focuses primarily on volatility, probability of loss, or the probability of underperforming a benchmark. Pension funds use risk measures to evaluate asset/liability mismatch and surplus at risk. Property and casualty insurers use sensitivity and exposure measures to ensure exposures remain within defined asset allocation ranges. They use economic capital and VaR measures to estimate the impairment in the event of a catastrophic loss. They use scenario analysis to stress the market risks and insurance risks simultaneously. Life insurers use risk measures to assess the exposures of the investment portfolio and the annuity liability, the extent of any asset/liability mismatch, and the potential stress losses based on the differences between the assets in which they have invested and the liabilities resulting from the insurance contracts they have written.",Measuring and Managing Market Risk,2024
"This reading focuses on three important areas of technical competency in the management of private client assets: the impact of taxes on wealth accumulation, the management of concentrated positions in public or private assets, and basic tools and techniques for preserving wealth through generations. We begin with a discussion of taxes. Taxes are an important determinant of the taxable investors final returns. While fees and trading costs have received a lot of attention in the press and academic spheres, the erosion of returns due to taxes can be much more significant. Consider this scenario: After significant development and testing, your firm has just launched a new strategy that tactically shifts between different equity indexes. The backtests show significant alpha over most time horizons and especially strong performance during market downturns—a risk/return profile that should be highly attractive to your clients. You launch the strategy 1 January, and everyone is pleased with the performance in the first year. On 15 February of the following year, the founder of the firm receives a telephone call from the accountant for Charles and Ivy Lee, an important private client relationship. The accountant has been compiling the Lees tax documents in preparation for filing the annual tax return. It seems that the trading activity inherent in your new strategy has generated a lot of capital gains, and the resulting tax bill is larger than the excess returns generated by your strategy! This scenario is not uncommon. Because a significant proportion of actively managed assets is managed on behalf of tax-exempt institutions, such as retirement plans and sovereign wealth funds, strategies are often developed either without regard to taxes or with taxes as an afterthought and then applied—unsuccessfully—to taxable investors. To illustrate the effect of taxes on wealth accumulation, lets examine a longer time horizon. The S&amp;P 500 Index from 1 January 1990 through 30 June 2019 appreciated 7.5% per year, on average. With dividends reinvested and ignoring fees and transaction costs, the compound annual growth rate would have been 9.8%. If the Lees had invested $1 million on 1 January 1990, we would expect their portfolio to have grown to $16 million by the end of the nearly 30-year period. However, this is only true if the assets are not subject to taxation during the accumulation phase, as would be the case if they are held in a retirement account or a private family foundation. If we assume the worst case, that both dividends and capital gains are taxed fully at a marginal tax rate of 50%, then the 9.8% compound annual growth rate would be cut roughly in half—to 5.0%. In other words, their $1 million would have only grown to $4 million after almost 30 years—only one-fourth of what the tax-exempt account realized. Clearly, taxes are an important investment consideration. Fortunately, as a tax-aware practitioner, you may be able to use various tax-management techniques to reduce the tax drag. If capital gains and dividends are taxed at 25%, the final wealth of the taxable portfolio would have grown to $8 million. If capital gains taxes can be eliminated or deferred and only dividends are taxed at the 25% rate, then the $1 million would have grown to $13 million at the end of our horizon. It is still not as good as the tax-exempt case, but it is significantly better than our worst case. Broadly speaking, a portfolio manager managing assets for a private client looks to maximize after-tax returns for a given level of risk. This reading lays the ground work for understanding how different types of taxes impact wealth accumulation. We review the general principles of taxation, how to measure tax efficiency, and how to reduce the impact of taxes on a portfolio. Hopefully weve convinced you why it is important to manage your clients portfolio with taxes in mind. Tax considerations, however, are just one element of managing assets for private wealth clients. Suppose that only 50% of your private clients assets are invested in your tax-aware investment strategy. The other 50% of assets are tied up in a company that was the primary source of wealth creation for your client: Ivy Lee started a business in her early 20s that succeeded far beyond her initial expectations. While she has accumulated liquid assets outside of that business, a substantial portion of her net worth is held in company stock. From your earlier readings in the course of the CFA Program, you realize that this is a very risky position. Taken in the aggregate, her portfolio is undiversified; however, to sell the position outright would create an enormous tax liability or lead to a loss of control over the business she created. How, then, do you help the client achieve her goals? This reading discusses some practical tools that you can employ to manage the risk of this concentrated position. Finally, Ivy and Charles want to maximize the likelihood that the strong financial foundation they have created will survive to provide support for their childrens and grandchildrens future endeavors. Ivy has frequently heard the phrase shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations, meaning that family wealth rarely survives beyond three generations. Some variation of that saying exists in many cultures. The Lees want your help to create a structure that will counter that conventional wisdom. While this reading wont make you an estate planning expert, it will prepare you to identify estate planning opportunities that may help the Lees achieve that goal and to work more effectively with the Lees estate planning professionals toward that end.","The member should be able to: compare taxation of income, wealth, and wealth transfers; describe global considerations of jurisdiction that are relevant to taxation; discuss and analyze the tax efficiency of investments; analyze the impact of taxes on capital accumulation and decumulation in taxable, tax-exempt, and tax-deferred accounts; explain portfolio tax management strategies and their application; discuss risk and tax objectives in managing concentrated single-asset positions; describe strategies for managing concentrated positions in public equities; describe strategies for managing concentrated positions in privately owned businesses and real estate; discuss objectives—tax and non-tax—in planning the transfer of wealth; discuss strategies for achieving estate, bequest, and lifetime gift objectives in common law and civil law regimes; describe considerations related to managing wealth across multiple generations.",Level III,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V4R4_topics_in_private_wealth_management.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/topics-in-private-wealth-management,"Even the best private wealth manager will never have all the answers. An effective private wealth manager will, however, be in a position to ask the right questions and consult the right experts to help clients navigate an increasingly complex world. This reading covers important points for managing assets on a tax-aware basis and managing concentrated positions in real estate and private and public equities. It also provides an overview of estate planning. Three foundational elements of investment taxation include: 1) taxation of the components of return, 2) the tax status of the account, and 3) the jurisdiction that applies to the investor (and/or account). Many countries tax codes create preferential treatment for some types of dividend and interest income. Long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than other forms of income. Income from real estate investments may be reduced by maintenance, interest, and depreciation expenses. Private clients often have a mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-exempt investment accounts. Returns in tax-deferred and tax-exempt accounts compound using the pre-tax rate of return. Tax-deferred accounts pay tax only when assets are withdrawn from the account. Taxable accounts compound using the after-tax rate of return. Broadly speaking, countries may operate under one of three tax regimes: tax havens, territorial tax systems, and worldwide tax systems. A tax haven has no or very low tax rates for foreign investors. A territorial regime taxes only locally-sourced income. A worldwide tax regime taxes all income, regardless of its source. The Common Reporting Standard exists to ensure exchange of financial account information to combat tax evasion. The United States uses FATCA, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, for the same purpose. Equity portfolios are often more tax efficient than strategies that rely on derivatives, real assets, or taxable fixed income. Higher-yield and higher-turnover strategies tend to be less tax efficient. The tax considerations associated with alternative asset classes are more complicated than those associated with stocks and bonds. Measures of tax efficiency include after-tax holding period return, annualized after-tax return, after-tax post-liquidation return, after-tax excess return, and the tax-efficiency ratio. Asset location is the process for determining which assets should be held in each type of account. A general rule of thumb is to put tax-efficient assets in the taxable account and tax-inefficient assets in the tax-exempt or tax-deferred account. The actual solution may differ depending on the strategy and the investors horizon. It is typically better to make withdrawals from the taxable account first and then from the tax-deferred accounts. Under progressive tax regimes, it may be more tax efficient to withdraw from the retirement account first until the lowest tax brackets have been fully utilized. Tax avoidance is the legal activity of understanding the tax laws and finding approaches that avoid or minimize taxation. Tax evasion is the illegal concealment and non-payment of taxes that are otherwise due. Tax avoidance strategies include holding assets in a tax-exempt account versus a taxable account, investing in tax-exempt bonds instead of taxable bonds, holding assets long enough to qualify for long-term capital gains treatment, and holding dividend-paying stocks long enough to pay the more favorable tax rate. Tax-deferral strategies include limiting portfolio turnover and the consequent realization of capital gains and tax loss harvesting. The structure of the investment vehicle in which a clients assets are held may affect the tax liability and the advisers ability to manage the client portfolio in a tax-aware manner. In a partnership, the income, realized capital gains, and realized capital losses are passed through to the investors, who are then responsible for any tax liability. In a mutual fund, the income and realized capital gains (but not losses) are passed through to the investors. The taxation of capital gains varies by jurisdiction. Potential capital gain exposure (PCGE) can be used to gauge the amount of tax liability embedded in a mutual fund. Exchange-traded funds are very tax efficient. Separately-managed accounts offer the most flexibility for tax management. Tax loss harvesting is a technique whereby the manager realizes a loss that can be used to offset gains or other income. Tax loss harvesting requires diligent tax lot accounting. Common methods of tax lot accounting are first in, first out (FIFO); last in, first out (LIFO); and highest in, first out (HIFO). A concentrated position subjects the portfolio to a higher level of risk, including unsystematic risk and liquidity risk. Approaches that can be used to mitigate the risks of a concentrated position include sell and diversify; staged diversification; hedging and monetization strategies; tax-free exchanges; tax-deferral strategies; and estate and tax planning strategies, such as charitable trusts, private foundations, and donor-advised funds. A completion portfolio is an index-based portfolio that when added to the concentrated position, creates an overall portfolio with exposures similar to the investors benchmark. Equity monetization refers to a group of strategies that allows an investor to receive cash for a stock position without an outright sale. The investor can hedge a part of the position using a short sale, a total return swap, options, futures, or a forward sale contract and then borrow against the hedged position. The loan proceeds are then invested in a diversified portfolio of other investments. Donating the appreciated asset to a charitable remainder trust allows the shares to be sold without incurring a capital gains tax. The trust can then build a diversified portfolio to provide income for the life of the beneficiaries. Strategies to free up capital concentrated in a privately-owned business or real estate include a personal line of credit secured by company shares, leveraged recapitalization, an employee stock ownership plan, mortgage financing, and a charitable trust or donor-advised fund. Estate planning is the process of preparing for the disposition of ones estate upon death and during ones lifetime. Objectives of gift and estate planning include maintaining sufficient income and liquidity, achieving the clients goals with respect to control over the assets, protection of the assets from creditors, minimization of tax liability, preservation of family wealth, business succession, and achieving charitable goals. An estate tax is the tax on the aggregate value of a deceased persons assets. It is paid out of the estate. An inheritance tax is paid by each individual beneficiary. A gift tax is paid on a transfer of money or property to another person without receiving at least equal value in return. Many jurisdictions have tax-free allowances that can be used for transferring assets under a certain threshold without paying an estate or inheritance tax. A will outlines the rights others will have over ones property after death. Probate is the legal process to confirm the validity of the will. Common law jurisdictions give owners the right to use their own judgment regarding the rights others will have over their property after death. Many civil law countries place restrictions on the disposition of an estate, typically giving certain relatives some minimum share of the assets. Common estate planning tools include trusts, foundations, life insurance, and companies. A trust is a legal relationship in which the trustee holds and manages the assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries. A trust can be either revocable or irrevocable. An irrevocable trust generally provides greater asset protection from creditors. A foundation is typically established to hold assets for a specific charitable purpose. The founder can exercise some control in the administration and decision making of the foundation. Life insurance and other forms of insurance can be used to accomplish estate planning objectives. Companies—specifically, a controlled foreign corporation—may allow the owner to defer taxes on income until the earnings are distributed to shareholders or until the company is sold or shares otherwise disposed. Family governance is a process for a familys collective communication and decision making designed to serve current and future generations. Good family governance establishes principles for collaboration among family members, preserving and growing familys wealth, and increasing human and financial capital across the generations. A sound family governance system may mitigate many of the behavioral biases that impede effective decision making. Conflict resolution can be particularly challenging in a family context. A family constitution can help wealthy families anticipate possible conflicts and agree on a common set of rights, values, and responsibilities. Managing a concentrated position arising from a family business is more than just an investment issue. The private wealth adviser should be prepared to work with the client in succession planning and post-sale considerations, such as the loss of a key activity that united family members. Effective estate planning requires planning for the unexpected, including divorce and incapacity.",Topics in Private Wealth Management,2024
"Securities research, portfolio management, and securities trading support the investment process. Of the three, trading is often the least understood and least appreciated function. Among the questions addressed in this reading are the following: What are explicit and implicit trading costs, and how are they measured? How is a limit order book interpreted? How have trading strategies adapted to market fragmentation? What types of electronic traders can be distinguished? This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the direct and indirect costs of trading. Section 3 discusses developments in electronic trading and the effects they had on transaction costs and market fragmentation. Section 4 identifies the most important types of electronic traders. Section 5 describes electronic trading facilities and some important ways traders use them. Section 6 discusses risks posed by electronic trading and how regulators control them. Finally, Section 7 summarizes the reading.","The member should be able to: explain the components of execution costs, including explicit and implicit costs; calculate and interpret effective spreads and VWAP transaction cost estimates; describe the implementation shortfall approach to transaction cost measurement; describe factors driving the development of electronic trading systems; describe market fragmentation; distinguish among types of electronic traders; describe characteristics and uses of electronic trading systems; describe comparative advantages of low-latency traders; describe the risks associated with electronic trading and how regulators mitigate them; describe abusive trading practices that real-time surveillance of markets may detect.",Level II,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L2V6R3-trading-costs-electronic-markets.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/trading-costs-electronic-markets,"This reading explains the implicit and explicit costs of trading as well as widely used methods for estimating transaction costs. The reading also describes developments in electronic trading, the main types of electronic traders, their needs for speed and ways in which they trade. Electronic trading benefits investors through lower transaction costs and greater efficiencies but also introduces systemic risks and the need to closely monitor markets for abusive trading practices. Appropriate market governance and regulatory policies will help reduce the likelihood of events such as the 2010 Flash Crash. The readings main points include: Dealers provide liquidity to buyers and sellers when they take the other side of a trade if no other willing traders are present. The bid–ask spread is the difference between the bid and the ask prices. The effective spread is two times the difference between the trade price and the midquote price before the trade occurred. The effective spread is a poor estimate of actual transaction costs when large orders have been filled in many parts over time or when small orders receive price improvement. Transaction costs include explicit costs and implicit costs. Explicit costs are the direct costs of trading. They include broker commissions, transaction taxes, stamp duties, and exchange fees. Implicit costs include indirect costs, such as the impact of the trade on the price received. The bid–ask spread, market impact, delay, and unfilled trades all contribute to implicit trading costs. The implementation shortfall method measures the total cost of implementing an investment decision by capturing all explicit and implicit trading costs. It includes the market impact costs, delay costs, as well as opportunity costs. The VWAP method of estimating transaction costs compares average fill prices to average market prices during a period surrounding the trade. It tends to produce lower transaction cost estimates than does implementation shortfall because it often does not measure the market impact of an order well. Markets have become increasingly fragmented as venues trading the same instruments have proliferated. Trading in any given instrument now occurs in multiple venues. The advantages of electronic trading systems include cost and operational efficiencies, lack of human bias, extraordinarily fast speed, and infinite span and scope of attention. Latency is the elapsed time between the occurrence of an event and a subsequent action that depends on that event. Traders use fast communication systems and fast computer systems to minimize latency to execute their strategies faster than others. Hidden orders, quote leapfrogging, flickering quotes, and the use of machine learning to support trading strategies commonly are found in electronic markets. Traders commonly use advanced order types, trading tactics, and algorithms in electronic markets. Electronic trading has benefited investors through greater trade process efficiencies and reduced transaction costs. At the same time, electronic trading has increased systemic risks. Examples of systemic risks posed by electronic traders include: runaway algorithms that produce streams of unintended orders caused by programming mistakes, fat finger errors that occur when a manual trader submits a larger order than intended, overlarge orders that demand more liquidity than the market can provide, and malevolent order streams created deliberately to disrupt the markets. Real-time surveillance of markets often can detect order front running and various market manipulation strategies. Market manipulators use such improper activities as trading for market impact, rumormongering, wash trading, and spoofing to further their schemes. Market manipulation strategies include bluffing, squeezing, cornering, and gunning.",Trading Costs and Electronic Markets,2023
"Most investors do not hold securities directly but rather invest using intermediaries. Whether the intermediary is a separately managed account or a pooled investment vehicle, such as mutual funds in the United States, unit trusts in the United Kingdom, Undertakings for the Collective Investment of Transferable Securities (UCITS) in the European Union, hedge funds, private equity funds, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a professional investment manager is being entrusted with helping investors achieve their investment objectives. In all of these cases, the selection of appropriate investment managers is a challenge with important financial consequences. Evaluating an investment manager is a complex and detailed process that encompasses a great deal more than analyzing investment returns. The investigation and analysis in support of an investment action, decision, or recommendation is called due diligence. In conducting investment manager due diligence, the focus is on understanding how the investment results were achieved and on assessing the likelihood that the investment process that generated these returns will produce superior or at least satisfactory investment results going forward. Due diligence also entails an evaluation of a firms integrity, operations, and personnel. As such, due diligence involves both quantitative and qualitative analysis. This reading provides a framework that introduces and describes the important elements of the manager selection process. Although it is important to have a well-defined methodology, this reading is not intended to be a rigid checklist, a step-by-step guide, or an in-depth analysis but rather to present a structure from which the reader can develop their own approach. We assume that the investment policy statement (IPS) has been drafted, the asset allocation determined, and the decision to use an outside adviser has been made. As a result, the focus is on determining which manager offers the best means to implement or express those decisions. The discussion has three broad topics: Outlining a framework for identifying, evaluating, and ultimately selecting investment managers (Section 2). Quantitative considerations in manager selection (Section 3). Qualitative considerations in manager selection (Section 4). The reading concludes with a summary of selected important points.","The member should be able to: describe the components of a manager selection process, including due diligence; contrast Type I and Type II errors in manager hiring and continuation decisions; describe uses of returns-based and holdings-based style analysis in investment manager selection; describe uses of the upside capture ratio, downside capture ratio, maximum drawdown, drawdown duration, and up/down capture in evaluating managers; evaluate a managers investment philosophy and investment decision-making process; evaluate the costs and benefits of pooled investment vehicles and separate accounts; compare types of investment manager contracts, including their major provisions and advantages and disadvantages; describe the three basic forms of performance-based fees; analyze and interpret a sample performance-based fee schedule.",Level III,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V5R4_investment_manager_selection.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/investment-manager-selection,"Evaluating an investment manager is a complex and detailed process. It encompasses a great deal more than analyzing investment returns. In conducting investment manager due diligence, the focus is on understanding how the investment results were achieved and assessing the likelihood that the manager will continue to follow the same investment process that generated these returns. This process also entails operational due diligence, including an evaluation of the integrity of the firm, its operations, and personnel, as well as evaluating the vehicle structure and terms. As such, due diligence involves both quantitative and qualitative analysis. This reading provides a framework that introduces and describes the important elements of the manager selection process: Investment manager selection involves a broad set of qualitative and quantitative considerations to determine whether a manager displays skill and the likelihood that the manager will continue to display skill in the future. The qualitative analysis consists of investment due diligence, which evaluates the managers investment process, investment personnel, and portfolio construction; and operational due diligence, which evaluates the managers infrastructure. A Type I error is hiring or retaining a manager who subsequently underperforms expectations—that is, rejecting the null hypothesis of no skill when it is correct. A Type II error is not hiring or firing a manager who subsequently outperforms, or performs in line with, expectations—that is, not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is incorrect. The manager search and selection process has three broad components: the universe, a quantitative analysis of the managers performance track record, and a qualitative analysis of the managers investment process. The qualitative analysis includes both investment due diligence and operational due diligence. Capture ratio measures the asymmetry of returns, and a ratio greater than 1 indicates greater participation in rising versus falling markets. Drawdown is the loss incurred in any continuous period of negative returns. The investment philosophy is the foundation of the investment process. The philosophy outlines the set of assumptions about the factors that drive performance and the managers beliefs about their ability to successfully exploit these sources of return. The investment manager should have a clear and concise investment philosophy. It is important to evaluate these assumptions and the role they play in the investment process to understand how the strategy will behave over time and across market environments. The investment process has to be consistent and appropriate for the philosophy, and the investment personnel need to possess sufficient expertise and experience to effectively execute the investment process. Style analysis, understanding the managers risk exposures relative to the benchmark, is an important component of performance appraisal and manager selection, helping to define the universe of suitable managers. Returns-based style analysis is a top-down approach that involves estimating the risk exposures from an actual return series for a given period. Although RBSA adds an additional analytical step, the analysis is straightforward and should identify the important drivers of return and risk factors for the period analyzed. It can be estimated even for complicated strategies and is comparable across managers and through time. The disadvantage is that RBSA is an imprecise tool, attributing performance to an unchanging average portfolio during the period that might not reflect the current or future portfolio exposures. Holdings-based style analysis is a bottom-up approach that estimates the risk exposures from the actual securities held in the portfolio at a point in time. HBSA allows for the estimation of current risk factors and should identify all important drivers of return and risk factors, be comparable across managers and through time, and provide an accurate view of the managers risk exposures. The disadvantages are the additional computational effort, dependence on the degree of transparency provided by the manager, and the possibility that accuracy may be compromised by stale pricing and window dressing. The prospectus, private placement memorandum, and/or limited partnership agreement are, in essence, the contract between the investor and the manager, outlining each partys rights and responsibilities. The provisions are liquidity terms and fees. Limited liquidity reduce the investors flexibility to adjust portfolio allocations in light of changing market conditions or investor circumstances. On the other hand, limited liquidity allows the funds to take long-term views and hold less liquid securities with reduced risk of having to divest assets at inopportune times in response to redemption requests. A management fee lowers the level of realized return without affecting the standard deviation, whereas a performance fee has the added effect of lowering the realized standard deviation. The preference is for more-linear compensation to reduce the incentives to change the portfolios risk profile at inflection points. The choice between individual separate accounts and pooled (or commingled) vehicles is dependent upon the consistency with the investment process, the suitability for the investor IPS, and whether the benefits outweigh the additional costs. Investment management fees take one of two forms: a fixed percentage fee based on assets under management or a performance-based fee which charges a percentage of the portfolios total return or excess return over a benchmark or hurdle rate. Performance-based fees work to align the interests of managers and investors because both parties share in investment results. Most managers that charge a performance fee also charge some level of fixed percentage fee to aid business continuity efforts. Fee structures must be designed carefully to avoid favoring one party over the other.",Investment Manager Selection,2024
"Investors often seek regular income from their investments as well as a predetermined date when their capital will be returned. Fixed-income investments offer both. Fixed-income instruments include a broad range of publicly traded securities (such as commercial paper, notes, and bonds traded through exchanges as well as OTC) and non-publicly traded instruments (such as loans and private placements). Individual loans or fixed-income obligations may be bundled into a pool of assets supporting such instruments as asset-backed securities and covered bonds. Fixed-income portfolio managers combine these diverse instruments across issuers, maturities, and jurisdictions to meet the various needs of investors. We discuss the different roles of fixed-income securities in portfolios and explain the two main types of fixed-income mandates—liability-based mandates and total return mandates—as well as bond market liquidity. We also provide an overview of portfolio measures, instruments, and vehicles used in fixed-income portfolio management and introduce a model of how a bond positions total expected return can be decomposed.","The member should be able to: discuss roles of fixed-income securities in portfolios and how fixed-income mandates may be classified; describe fixed-income portfolio measures of risk and return as well as correlation characteristics; describe bond market liquidity, including the differences among market sub-sectors, and discuss the effect of liquidity on fixed-income portfolio management; describe and interpret a model for fixed-income returns; discuss the use of leverage, alternative methods for leveraging, and risks that leverage creates in fixed-income portfolios; discuss differences in managing fixed-income portfolios for taxable and tax-exempt investors. ",Level III,https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level3/RR_2024_L3V2R4_fixed_income_portfolio_management.pdf,https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/overview-fixed-income-portfolio-management,"Fixed-income investments provide diversification benefits in a portfolio context. These benefits arise from the generally low correlations of fixed-income investments with other major asset classes, such as equities. Floating-rate and inflation-linked bonds can be used to hedge inflation risk. Fixed-income investments have regular cash flows, which is beneficial for the purposes of funding future liabilities. For liability-based fixed-income mandates, portfolio construction follows two main approaches—cash flow matching and duration matching—to match fixed-income assets with future liabilities. Total return mandates are generally structured to either track or outperform a benchmark. Total return mandates can be classified into various approaches according to their target active return and active risk levels. Approaches range from pure indexing to enhanced indexing to active management. Bond Portfolio Duration is the sensitivity of a portfolio of bonds to small changes in interest rates. It can be calculated as the weighted average of time to receipt of the aggregate cash flows or, more commonly, as the weighted average of the individual bond durations that comprise the portfolio. Modified Duration of a Bond Portfolio indicates the percentage change in the market value given a change in yield-to-maturity. Convexity of a bond portfolio is a second-order effect; it operates behind duration in importance and can largely be ignored for small yield changes. When convexity is added with the use of derivatives, however, it can be extremely important to returns. Effective duration and convexity of a portfolio are the relevant summary statistics when future cash flows of bonds in a portfolio are contingent on interest rate changes. Spread duration is a useful measure for determining a portfolios sensitivity to changes in credit spreads. It provides the approximate percentage increase (decrease) in bond price expected for a 1% decrease (increase) in credit spread. Duration times spread is a modification of the spread duration definition to incorporate the empirical observation that spread changes across the credit spectrum tend to occur on a proportional percentage basis rather than being based on absolute basis point changes. Portfolio dispersion captures the variance of the times to receipt of cash flows around the duration. It is used in measuring interest rate immunization for liabilities. Duration management is the primary tool used by fixed-income portfolio managers. Convexity supplements duration as a measure of a bonds price sensitivity for larger movements in interest rates. Adjusting convexity can be an important portfolio management tool. For two portfolios with the same duration, the portfolio with higher convexity has higher sensitivity to large declines in yields to maturity and lower sensitivity to large increases in yields to maturity. Interest rate derivatives can be used effectively to increase or decrease duration and convexity in a bond portfolio. Liquidity is an important consideration in fixed-income portfolio management. Bonds are generally less liquid than equities, and liquidity varies greatly across sectors. Liquidity affects pricing in fixed-income markets because many bonds either do not trade or trade infrequently. Liquidity affects portfolio construction because there is a trade-off between liquidity and yield to maturity. Less liquid bonds have higher yields to maturity, all else being equal, and may be more desirable for buy-and-hold investors. Investors anticipating liquidity needs may forgo higher yields to maturity for more liquid bonds. Investors can obtain exposure to the bond market using mutual funds and ETFs that track a bond index. Shares in mutual funds are redeemable at the net asset value with a one-day time lag. ETF shares have the advantage of trading on an exchange. A total return swap, an over-the-counter derivative, allows an institutional investor to transform an asset or liability from one asset category to another—for instance, from variable-rate cash flows referencing the market reference rate to the total return on a particular bond index. A total return swap can have some advantages over a direct investment in a bond mutual fund or ETF. As a derivative, it requires less initial cash outlay than direct investment in the bond portfolio for similar performance but carries counterparty risk. As a customized over-the-counter product, a TRS can offer exposure to assets that are difficult to access directly, such as some high-yield and commercial loan investments. When evaluating fixed-income investment strategies, it is important to consider expected returns and to understand the various components of expected returns. Decomposing expected fixed-income returns allows investors to understand the different sources of returns given expected changes in bond market conditions. A model for expected fixed-income returns can decompose them into the following components: coupon income, rolldown return, expected change in price based on investors views of yields to maturity and yield spreads, and expected currency gains or losses. Leverage is the use of borrowed capital to increase the magnitude of portfolio positions. By using leverage, fixed-income portfolio managers may be able to increase portfolio returns relative to what they can achieve in unleveraged portfolios. The potential for increased returns, however, comes with increased risk. Methods for leveraging fixed-income portfolios include the use of futures contracts, swap agreements, repurchase agreements, structured financial instruments, and security lending. Taxes can complicate investment decisions in fixed-income portfolio management. Complications result from the differences in taxation among investor types, countries, and income sources. The two primary sources of investment income that affect taxes for fixed-income securities are coupon payments (interest income) and capital gains or losses. Tax is usually payable only on capital gains and interest income that have actually been received. Capital gains are frequently taxed at a lower effective tax rate than interest income. If capital losses exceed capital gains in the year, they can often be carried forward and applied to gains in future years. ",Overview of Fixed-Income Portfolio Management,2024
